<p class="title"><span style="font-size: 175%;">HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION IN ENGLAND.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">CONDITION OF SCOTLAND TO THE END OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.</div>

<p>In the preceding view of the rise and decay of Spain,
I have sought to exhibit the successive steps by
which what was formerly one of the greatest nations of
the earth, was broken, and cast down from its high
estate. As we look back on that scene, the picture is,
indeed, striking. A country rich in all natural productions,
inhabited by a brave, a loyal, and a religious
people, removed, too, by its geographical position from
the hazards of European revolutions, did, by the operation
of those general causes which I have indicated,
suddenly rise to unparalleled grandeur; and then, without
the occurrence of any new combination, but by a
mere continuance of the same causes, fall with an equal
velocity. Yet, these vicissitudes, strange and startling
as they appear, were perfectly regular. They were the
legitimate consequence of a state of society, in which
the spirit of protection had reached its highest point,
and in which, every thing being done for the people,
nothing was done by the people. Whenever this happens,
there may be great political progress, but there
can be no really national progress. There may be accessions
of territory, and vast increase of fame and of power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
There may be improvements in the practice of administration,
in the management of finances, in the organization
of armies, in the art and theory of war, in the tricks
of diplomacy, and in those various contrivances by which
one nation is able to outwit and insult another. So
far, however, from this benefiting the people, it will
injure them in two different ways. In the first place,
by increasing the reputation of the ruling classes, it
encourages that blind and servile respect which men
are too apt to feel for those who are above them, and
which, wherever it has been generally practised, has
been found fatal to the highest qualities of the citizen,
and therefore to the permanent grandeur of the nation.
And, in the second place, it multiplies the resources of
the executive government, and thus renders the country
unable, as well as unwilling, to correct the errors of
those who are at the head of affairs. Hence, in Spain,
as in all countries similarly circumstanced, it was at the
very moment when things were most prosperous at
the surface, that they were most rotten at the foundation.
In presence of the most splendid political success,
the nation hastened to its downfall, and the crisis was
fast approaching, in which, the whole edifice being overturned,
nothing would be left, except a memorable
warning of the consequences which must ensue, when
the people, giving themselves up to the passions of
superstition and loyalty, abdicate their own proper
functions, forego their own responsibility, renounce
their highest duties, and degrade themselves into passive
instruments to serve the will of the Church and
the throne.</p>

<p>Such is the great lesson taught by the history of
Spain. From the history of Scotland, we may gather
another lesson, of a different, and yet of a similar, kind.
In Scotland, the progress of the nation has been very
slow, but, on the whole, very sure. The country is
extremely barren; the executive government has, with
rare exceptions, been always weak; and the people have
never been burdened with those feelings of loyalty which
circumstances had forced upon the Spaniards. Certainly,
the last charge that will be brought against the Scotch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
is that of superstitious attachment to their princes.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
We, in England, have not always been very tender of
the persons of our sovereigns, and we have occasionally
punished them with what some consider excessive
severity. With this, we have been frequently taunted
by the more loyal nations of the Continent; and, in
Spain in particular, our conduct has excited the greatest
abhorrence. But, if we compare our history with that
of our northern neighbours, we must pronounce ourselves
a meek and submissive people.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There have
been more rebellions in Scotland than in any other
country; and the rebellions have been very sanguinary,
as well as very numerous. The Scotch have made war
upon most of their kings, and put to death many. To
mention their treatment of a single dynasty, they murdered
James I. and James III. They rebelled against
James II. and James VII. They laid hold of James V.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and placed him in confinement. Mary, they immured
in a castle, and afterwards deposed. Her successor,
James VI., they imprisoned; they led him captive about
the country, and on one occasion attempted his life.
Towards Charles I., they showed the greatest animosity,
and they were the first to restrain his mad career. Three
years before the English ventured to rise against that
despotic prince, the Scotch boldly took up arms, and
made war on him. The service which they then rendered
to the cause of liberty it would be hard to overrate;
but the singular part of the transaction was, that
having afterwards got possession of the person of Charles,
they sold him to the English for a large sum of money,
of which they, being very poor, had pressing need. Such
a sale is unparalleled in history; and although the Scotch
might have plausibly alleged that this was the only
gain they had derived, or ever could derive, from the
existence of their hereditary prince, still the event is
one which stands alone; it was unprecedented; it has
never been imitated; and its occurrence is a striking
symptom of the state of public opinion, and of the feelings
of the country in which it was permitted.</p>

<p>While, however, in regard to loyalty, the opposition
between Scotland and Spain is complete, there is, strange
to say, the most striking similarity between those countries
in regard to superstition. Both nations have
allowed their clergy to exercise immense sway, and
both have submitted their actions, as well as their
consciences, to the authority of the Church. As a
natural consequence, in both countries, intolerance has
been, and still is, a crying evil; and in matters of religion,
a bigotry is habitually displayed, discreditable indeed
to Spain, but far more discreditable to Scotland,
which has produced many philosophers of the highest
eminence, who would willingly have taught the people
better things, but who have vainly attempted to remove
from the national mind that serious blemish which mars
its beauty, and tends to neutralize its many other admirable
qualities.</p>

<p>Herein lies the apparent paradox, and the real difficulty,
of Scotch history. That knowledge should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
have produced the effects which have elsewhere followed
it; that a bold and inquisitive literature should be found
in a grossly superstitious country, without diminishing
its superstition; that the people should constantly withstand
their kings, and as constantly succumb to their
clergy; that while they are liberal in politics, they
should be illiberal in religion; and that, as a natural
consequence of all this, men who, in the visible and
external department of facts and of practical life, display
a shrewdness and a boldness rarely equalled, should
nevertheless, in speculative life, and in matters of theory,
tremble like sheep before their pastors, and yield assent
to every absurdity they hear, provided their Church has
sanctioned it; that these discrepancies should coexist,
seems at first sight a strange contradiction, and is surely
a phenomenon worthy of our careful study. To indicate
the causes of this anomaly, and to trace the results to
which the anomaly has led, will be the business of the
remaining part of this volume; and although the investigation
will be somewhat lengthy, it will not, I hope,
be considered prolix, by those who recognise the importance
of the inquiry, and are aware how completely
it has been neglected, even by those who have written
most fully on the history of the Scottish nation.</p>

<p>In Scotland, as elsewhere, the course of events has
been influenced by its physical geography; and by this
I mean, not only its own immediate peculiarities, but
also its relation to adjoining countries. It is close to
Ireland; it touches England; and by the contiguity of
the Orkney and Shetland Isles, it was eminently exposed
to the attacks of that great nation of pirates,
which for centuries inhabited the Scandinavian peninsula.
Considered merely by itself, it is mountainous
and sterile; nature has interposed such obstacles, that
it was long impossible to open regular communications
between its different parts, which, indeed, in regard to
the Highlands, was not effected till after the middle of
the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Finally, and this, as we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
presently see, was a matter of great importance, the
most fertile land in Scotland is in the south, and was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
therefore, constantly ravaged by the English borderers.
Hence, the accumulation of wealth was hindered; the
growth of towns was discouraged, by the serious hazards
to which they were liable; and it was impossible to develop
that municipal spirit, which might have existed, if
the districts most favoured by nature had been situated
in the north of Scotland, instead of in the south. If
the actual state of things had been reversed, so that the
Highlands were in the south,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and the Lowlands in the
north, it can hardly be doubted, that, after the cessation
in the thirteenth century of the great Scandinavian invasions,
the most fertile parts of Scotland, being comparatively
secure, would have been the seat of towns,
which the active spirit of the people would have caused
to prosper, and the prosperity of which would have introduced
a new element into Scotch affairs, and changed
the course of Scotch history. This, however, was not
to be; and, as we have to deal with events as they actually
are, I will now endeavour to trace the consequences
of the physical peculiarities which have just
been noticed; and by coördinating their results, I
will, so far as I am able, show their general meaning,
and the way in which they have shaped the national
character.</p>

<p>The earliest fact with which we are acquainted
respecting the history of Scotland, is the Roman invasion
under Agricola, late in the first century. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
neither his conquests, nor those of his successors, made
any permanent impression. The country was never
really subjugated, and nothing was effected except a
military occupation, which, in spite of the erection of
numerous forts, walls, and ramparts, left the spirit of
the inhabitants unbroken. Even Severus, who, in the
year 209, undertook the last and most important expedition
against Scotland, does not appear to have penetrated
beyond the Firth of Moray;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and directly he
retired, the natives were again in arms, and again
independent. After this, nothing was attempted upon
a scale large enough to give a chance of success.
Indeed, the Romans, far from being equal to such an
effort, were themselves deteriorating. In their best
days, their virtues were the virtues of barbarians, and
even those they were now about to lose. From the
beginning, their scheme of life was so one-sided and
imperfect, that the increase of wealth, which improves
the civilization of really civilized countries, was to the
Romans an irreparable mischief; and they were corrupted
by luxury, instead of being refined by it. In
our time, if we compare the different nations of Europe,
we find that the richest are also the most powerful, the
most humane, and the most happy. We live in that
advanced state of society, in which wealth is both the
cause and the effect of progress, while poverty is the
fruitful parent of weakness, of misery, and of crime.
But the Romans, when they ceased to be poor, began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
be vicious. So unstable was the foundation of their
greatness, that the very results which their power
produced, were fatal to the power itself. Their empire
gave them wealth, and their wealth overthrew their
empire. Their national character, notwithstanding its
apparent strength, was in truth of so frail a texture,
that it was ruined by its own development. As it
grew, it dwarfed. Hence it was, that, in the third and
fourth centuries, their hold on mankind visibly slackened.
Their authority being undermined, other nations,
of course, stepped in; so that the inroads of those
strange tribes which came pouring from the north, and
to whose appearance the final catastrophe is often
ascribed, were at best the occasion, but by no means
the cause, of the fall of the Roman Empire. Towards
that great and salutary event, every thing had long been
pointing. The scourgers and oppressors of the world,
whom a false and ignorant sympathy has invested with
noble qualities which they never possessed, had now to
look to themselves; and when, after receding on all
sides, they, in the middle of the fifth century, withdrew
their forces from the whole of Britain, they merely
executed a movement, which a train of circumstances,
continued through several generations, had made
inevitable.</p>

<p>It is at this point that we begin to discern the operation
of those physical and geographical peculiarities
which I have mentioned as influencing the fortunes of
Scotland. The Romans, gradually losing ground, the
proximity of Ireland caused repeated attacks from that
fertile island, whose rich soil and great natural advantages
gave rise to an exuberant, and therefore a restless,
population. An overflow, which, in civilized times, is
an emigration, is, in barbarous times, an invasion.
Hence the Irish, or Scotti as they were termed, established
themselves by force of arms in the west of
Scotland, and came into collision with the Picts, who
occupied the eastern part. A deadly struggle ensued,
which lasted four centuries after the withdrawal of the
Romans, and plunged the country into the greatest
confusion. At length, in the middle of the ninth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
century, Kenneth M'Alpine, king of the Scotti, gained
the upper hand, and reduced the Picts to complete
submission.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The country was now united under one
rule; and the conquerors, slowly absorbing the conquered,
gave their name to the whole, which, in the
tenth century, received the appellation of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>But the kingdom was to have no rest. For, in the
mean time, circumstances, which it would be tedious to
relate, had raised the inhabitants of Norway to be the
greatest maritime power in Europe. The use which
that nation of pirates made of their strength, forms
another and a very important link in the history of
Scotland, and moreover illustrates the immense weight,
which, in an early period of society, should be assigned
to mere geographical considerations. The nearest land
to the centre of the long coast of Norway is the Shetland
Isles, whence it is an easy sail to the Orkneys.
The northern pirates naturally seized these small, but,
to them, most useful islands, and, as naturally, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
them intermediate stations, from which they could
conveniently pillage the coasts of Scotland. Being
constantly reinforced from Norway, they, in the ninth
and tenth centuries, advanced from the Orkneys, made
permanent settlements in Scotland itself, and occupied
not only Caithness, but also great part of Sutherland.
Another body of them got possession of the Western
Islands; and as Skye is only separated from the
mainland by a very narrow channel, these pirates easily
crossed over, and fixed themselves in Western Ross.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
From their new abodes, they waged incessant and
destructive war against every district within their
reach; and, keeping a large part of Scotland in constant
alarm, they, for about three centuries, prevented the
possibility of its social improvement. Indeed, that
unhappy country was never free from the dangers of
Norwegian invasion, until the failure of the last great
attack, in 1263, when Haco left Norway with a prodigious
armament, which he further strengthened by
reinforcements from the Orkneys and Hebrides. Scotland
could offer but little resistance. Haco, with his
allies, sailed along the western coast to the Mull of
Kentire, wasted the country with fire and sword, took
Arran and Bute, entered the Firth of Clyde, suddenly
fell upon Loch Lomond, destroyed all the property on
its shores and on its islands, ravaged the whole county
of Stirling, and threatened to descend with all his force
upon Ayrshire. Fortunately, the inclemency of the
weather broke up this great expedition, and scattered
or destroyed the entire fleet.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> After its dispersal, the
course of affairs in Norway prevented the attempt from
being renewed; and danger from that quarter being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
over, it might have been hoped that Scotland would
now enjoy peace, and would have leisure to develop the
natural resources which she possessed, particularly those
in the southern and more favoured districts.</p>

<p>This, however, was not to be. For, scarcely were
the attacks from Norway at an end, when those from
England began. Early in the thirteenth century, the
lines of demarcation which separated Normans from
Saxons, were, in our country, becoming so obliterated,
that in many cases it was impossible to distinguish
them.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> By the middle of the same century, the two
races were fused into one powerful nation; and, as that
nation had a comparatively feeble neighbour, it was
certain that the stronger people would try to oppress
the weaker.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In an ignorant and barbarous age,
military success is preferred to all other kinds of fame;
and the English, greedy for conquest, set their eyes
upon Scotland, which they were sure to invade at the
first opportunity. That Scotland was near, made it
tempting; that it was believed to be defenceless, made
the temptation irresistible. In 1290, Edward I. determined
to avail himself of the confusion into which
Scotland was thrown by disputes respecting the succession
of the crown. The intrigues which followed,
need not be related; it is enough to say, that, in 1296,
the sword was drawn, and Edward invaded a country
which he had long desired to conquer. But he little
recked of the millions of treasure, and the hundreds of
thousands of lives, which were to be squandered, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that war was over.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The contest that ensued was of
unexampled length and severity; and in its sad course,
the Scotch, notwithstanding their heroic resistance, and
the victories they occasionally gained, had to endure
every evil which could be inflicted by their proud and
insolent neighbour. The darling object of the English,
was to subjugate the Scotch; and if anything could
increase the disgrace of so base an enterprise, it would
be that, having undertaken it, they ignominiously
failed.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The suffering, however, was incalculable, and
was aggravated by the important fact, that it was
precisely the most fertile part of Scotland which was
most exposed to the English ravages. This, as we
shall presently see, produced some very curious results
on the national character; and for that reason, I will,
without entering into many details, give a slight summary
of the more immediate consequences of this long
and sanguinary struggle.</p>

<p>In 1296, the English entered Berwick, the richest
town Scotland possessed, and not only destroyed all the
property, but slew nearly all the inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
then marched on to Aberdeen and Elgin; and so
completely desolated the country, that the Scotch,
flying to the mountains, and stripped of their all, had
no resource left but to wage from their native fastnesses
a war similar to that which their savage ancestors,
twelve centuries earlier, had conducted against the
Romans.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In 1298, the English again broke in, burnt
Perth and St. Andrews, and ravaged the whole territory
south and west.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In 1310, they invaded Scotland by
the eastern march, and carrying off such provisions as
were left, caused so terrible a dearth, that the people
were forced to feed on horses and other carrion.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> All
over southern Scotland, both east and west, the inhabitants
were now reduced to a horrible condition, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
for the most part houseless and starved. In 1314, made
desperate by their state, they rallied for a moment, and,
in the battle of Bannockburn, gloriously defeated their
oppressors. But their unrelenting enemy was at hand,
and pressed them so hard, that, in 1322, Bruce, in order
to baffle an English invasion, was obliged to lay waste
all the districts south of the Firth of Forth; the people
taking refuge, as before, in the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> This
time, therefore, when Edward II. reached Edinburgh,
he plundered nothing, because, the country being a
desert, there was nothing to plunder; but, on his
return, he did what he could, and meeting with some
convents, which were the only signs of life that he
encountered, he fell upon them, robbed the monasteries
of Melrose and Holyrood, burnt the abbey of Dryburgh,
and slew those monks who, from age or disease, were
unable to escape.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In 1336, the next king, Edward
III., equipped a numerous army, devastated the Lowlands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and great part of the Highlands, and destroyed
every thing he could find, as far as Inverness.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In
1346, the English overran the districts of Tweeddale,
the Merse, Ettrick, Annandale, and Galloway;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and in
1355, Edward, in a still more barbarous inroad, burnt
every church, every village, and every town he approached.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
And scarcely were these frightful losses
somewhat repaired, when another storm burst upon the
devoted land. In 1385, Richard II. traversed the
southern counties to Aberdeen, scattering destruction on
every side, and reducing to ashes the cities of Edinburgh,
Dunfermline, Perth, and Dundee.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>By these disasters, the practice of agriculture was
every where interrupted, and in many places ceased for
several generations.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The labourers either fled, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
were murdered; and there being no one to till the
ground, some of the fairest parts of Scotland were
turned into a wilderness, overgrown with briers and
thickets. Between the invasions, a few of the inhabitants,
taking courage, issued from the mountains, and
raised wretched huts in the place of their former
abodes. But, even then, they were pursued to their
very doors by wolves, searching for food, and maddened
with hunger. If they escaped from these
famished and ferocious animals, they and their families
were exposed to a danger still more horrible. For,
in those terrible days, when famine stalked abroad,
despair perverted the souls of men, and drove them to
new crime. There were cannibals in the land; and we
have it on contemporary authority, that a man and his
wife, who were at length brought to justice, subsisted
during a considerable period on the bodies of children,
whom they caught alive in traps, devouring their flesh,
and drinking their blood.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Thus the fourteenth century passed away. In the
fifteenth century, the devastations of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
became comparatively rare; and although the borders
were the scene of constant hostilities,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> there is no
instance, since the year 1400, of any of our kings invading
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> An end being put to those
murderous expeditions, which reduced the country to
a desert, Scotland drew breath, and began to recover
her strength.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But, though the material losses were
gradually repaired; though the fields were again cultivated,
and the towns rebuilt, there were other consequences,
which were less easy to remedy, and from
whose effects the people long smarted. These were
inordinate power of the nobles, and the absence of the
municipal spirit. The strength of the nobles, and the
weakness of the citizens, are the most important peculiarities
of Scotland during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries; and they, as I am about to show, were
directly encouraged by the ravages committed by the
English troops. We shall, moreover, see that this
combination of events increased the authority of the
clergy, weakened the influence of the intellectual
classes, and made superstition more prevalent than it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
would otherwise have been. It is in this way, that in
Scotland, as in all other countries, every thing is linked
together; nothing is casual or accidental; and the
whole march of affairs is governed by general causes,
which, owing to their largeness and remoteness, often
escape attention, but which, when once recognized,
are found to be marked by a simplicity and uniformity,
which are the invariable characteristics of the highest
truths that the mind of man has reached.</p>

<p>The first circumstance favourable to the authority of
the nobles, was the structure of the country. Mountains,
fens, lakes, and morasses, which even the resources
of modern art have only recently made accessible
supplied the great Scottish chieftains with retreats,
in which they could with impunity defy the power of
the crown.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The poverty of the soil also, made it
difficult for armies to find means of subsistence; and
from this cause alone, the royal troops were often
unable to pursue the lawless and refractory barons.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
During the fourteenth century, Scotland was constantly
ravaged by the English; and in the intervals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
their absence, it would have been a hopeless undertaking
for any king to try to repress such powerful
subjects, since he would have had to march through
districts so devastated by the enemy, that they no
longer yielded the common necessaries of life. Besides
this, the war with the English lessened the authority
of the crown, absolutely as well as relatively. Its
patrimony, lying in the south, was incessantly wasted
by the borderers, and before the middle of the fourteenth
century, greatly deteriorated in value.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In
1346, David II. fell into the hands of the English, and
during his captivity of eleven years, the nobles carried
all before them, and affected, says an historian, the
style and title of princes.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The longer the war with
England continued, the more these consequences were
felt; so that before the close of the fourteenth century,
a few of the leading Scotch families had raised themselves
to such preëminence, that it was evident, either
that a deadly struggle must ensue between them and
the crown, or else that the executive government
would have to abdicate its most essential functions,
and leave the country a prey to these headstrong and
ferocious chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>At this crisis, the natural allies of the throne would
have been the citizens and free burgesses, who in most
European countries were the eager and resolute opponents
of the nobles, whose licentious habits interfered
not only with their trade and manufactures, but also
with their personal liberty. Here again, however, the
long war with England was favourable to the aristocracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of Scotland. For, as the invaders ravaged the
southern parts of Scotland, which were also the only
tolerably fertile parts, it was impossible that towns
should flourish in the places which nature had appointed
for them. There being no large cities, there
was no asylum for the citizens, and there could be no
municipal spirit. There being no municipal spirit,
the crown was deprived of that great resource, which
enabled the English kings to curtail the power of the
nobles, and to punish a lawlessness which long
impeded the progress of society.</p>

<p>During the middle ages, the Scotch towns were so
utterly insignificant, that but few notices have been
preserved of them; contemporary writers concentrating
their attention upon the proceedings of the nobles
and clergy. Respecting the people, who found shelter
in such miserable cities as then existed, our best
accounts are very imperfect; it is, however, certain
that, during the long English wars, the inhabitants
usually fled at the approach of the invaders, and the
wretched hovels in which they lived were burned to the
ground.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Hence the population acquired a fluctuating
and vagabond character, which prevented the formation
of settled habits of industry, and thus took away
one reason which men have for congregating together.
This applied more especially to the southern Lowlands;
for the north, there were other evils equally threatening.
The ferocious Highlanders, who lived entirely
by plunder, were constantly at hand; and to them
were not unfrequently added the freebooters of the
Western Isles. Any thing which bore even the
semblance of wealth, was an irresistible excitement to
their cupidity. They could not know that a man
had property, without longing to steal it; and, next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to stealing, their greatest pleasure was to destroy.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Aberdeen and Inverness were particularly exposed to
their assaults; and twice during the fifteenth century,
Inverness was totally consumed by fire, besides having
to pay at other times a heavy ransom, to save itself
from a similar fate.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Such insecurity<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> both on the north and on the south,
made peaceful industry impossible in any part of Scotland.
No where could a town be built, without being
in danger of immediate destruction. The consequence
was, that, during many centuries, there were no manufactures;
there was hardly any trade; and nearly all
business was conducted by barter.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Some of the commonest
arts were unknown. The Scotch were unable
to make even the arms with which they fought. This,
among such a warlike people, would have been a very
profitable labour; but they were so ignorant of it, that,
early in the fifteenth century, most of the armour
which they wore was manufactured abroad, as also were
their spears, and even their bows and arrows; and the
heads of these weapons were entirely imported from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Indeed, the Flemish artizans supplied
the Scotch with ordinary farming implements, such as
cart-wheels and wheel-barrows, which, about the year
1475, used to be regularly shipped from the Low Countries.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
As to the arts which indicate a certain degree
of refinement, they were then, and long afterwards,
quite out of the question.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Until the seventeenth century,
no glass was manufactured in Scotland,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> neither
was any soap made there.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Even the higher class of
citizens would have deemed windows absurd in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
wretched abodes;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and as they were alike filthy in
their persons as in their houses, the demand for soap
was too small to induce any one to attempt its manufacture.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Other branches of industry were equally
backward. In 1620, the art of tanning leather was
for the first time introduced into Scotland;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and it is
stated, on apparently good authority, that no paper was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
made there until about the middle of the eighteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of such general stagnation, the most
flourishing towns were, as may be easily supposed, very
thinly peopled. Indeed, men had so little to do, that if
they had collected in large numbers, they must have
starved. Glasgow is one of the oldest cities in Scotland,
and is said to have been founded about the sixth century.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
At all events, in the twelfth century, it was,
according to the measure of that age, a rich and prosperous
place, enjoying the privilege of holding both a
market and a fair.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It had also a municipal organization,
and was governed by its own provosts and baillies.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Yet, even this famous town had no kind of trade before
the fifteenth century, when the inhabitants began
to cure salmon, and export it.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> That was the only
branch of industry with which Glasgow was acquainted.
We need not, therefore, be surprised at hearing, that so
late as the middle of the fifteenth century, the entire
population did not exceed fifteen hundred persons, whose
wealth consisted of some small cattle, and a few acres of
ill-cultivated land.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Other cities, though bearing a celebrated name, were
equally backward at a still more recent period. Dunfermline
is associated with many historic reminiscences;
it was a favourite residence of Scotch kings, and many
Scotch parliaments have been held there.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Such events
are supposed to confer distinction; but the illusion vanishes,
when we inquire more minutely into the condition
of the place where they happened. In spite of the
pomp of princes and legislators, Dunfermline, which at
the end of the fourteenth century was still a poor village,
composed of wooden huts,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> had, by the beginning
of the seventeenth century, advanced so slowly that its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
whole population, including that of its wretched suburbs,
did not exceed one thousand persons.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> For a Scotch
town, that was a considerable number. About the same
time, Greenock, we are assured, was a village consisting
of a single row of cottages, tenanted by poor fishermen.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Kilmarnock, which is now a great emporium of industry
and of wealth, contained, in 1668, between five and
six hundred inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> And, to come down still
lower, even Paisley itself, in the year 1700, possessed a
population which, according to the highest estimate,
did not amount to three thousand.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Aberdeen, the metropolis of the north, was looked up
to as one of the most influential of the Scotch towns,
and was not a little envied during the Middle Ages, for
its power and importance. These, however, like all
other words, are relative, and mean different things at
different periods. Certainly, we shall not be much struck
by the magnitude of that city, when we learn, from calculations
made from its tables of mortality, that so late
as 1572, it could only boast of about two thousand nine
hundred inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Such a fact will dispel many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
dream respecting the old Scotch towns, particularly
if we call to mind that it refers to a date, when the
anarchy of the Middle Ages was passing away, and
Aberdeen had for some time been improving. That city&mdash;if
so miserable a collection of persons deserves to be
termed a city&mdash;was, nevertheless, one of the most densely
peopled places in Scotland. From the thirteenth century
to the close of the sixteenth, no where else were
so many Scotchmen assembled together, except in
Perth, Edinburgh, and possibly in Saint Andrews.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Respecting
Saint Andrews, I have been unable to meet with
any precise information;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> but of Perth and Edinburgh,
some particulars are preserved. Perth was long the
capital of Scotland, and after losing that preëminence, it
was still reputed to be the second city in the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Its wealth was supposed to be astonishing; and every
good Scotchman was proud of it, as one of the chief
ornaments of his country.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> But, according to an estimate
recently made by a considerable authority in these
matters, its entire population, in the year 1585, was
under nine thousand.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> This will surprise many readers;
though, considering the state of society at that time,
the real wonder is, not that there were so few, but that
there were so many. For, Edinburgh itself, notwithstanding
the officials and numerous hangers-on, which
the presence of a court always brings, did not contain,
late in the fourteenth century, more than sixteen thousand
persons.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Of their general condition, a contemporary
observer has left us some account. Froissart,
who visited Scotland, and records what he saw, as well
as what he heard, gives a lamentable picture of the state
of affairs. The houses in Edinburgh were mere huts,
thatched with boughs; and were so slightly put together,
that when one of them was destroyed, it only took three
days to rebuild it. As to the people who inhabited these
wretched hovels, Froissart, who was by no means given
to exaggeration, assures us, that the French, unless they
had seen them, could not have believed that such destitution
existed, and that now, for the first time, they
understood what poverty really was.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>After this period, there was, no doubt, considerable
improvement; but it was very slow, and even late
in the sixteenth century, skilled labour was hardly
known, and honest industry was universally despised.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
It is not, therefore, surprising, that the citizens, poor,
miserable, and ignorant, should frequently purchase
the protection of some powerful noble by yielding to
him the little independence that they might have retained.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Few of the Scotch towns ventured to elect
their chief magistrate from among their own people;
but the usual course was, to choose a neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
peer as provost or baillie.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Indeed, it often happened
that his office became hereditary, and was looked upon
as the vested right of some aristocratic family.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> To
the head of that family, every thing gave way. His
authority was so incontestable, that an injury done
even to one of his retainers was resented, as if it had
been done to himself.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The burgesses who were sent
to parliament, were completely dependent on the noble
who ruled the town. Down to quite modern times,
there was in Scotland no real popular representation.
The so-called representatives were obliged to vote as
they were ordered; they were, in fact, delegates of the
aristocracy; and as they possessed no chamber of their
own, they sat and deliberated in the midst of their
powerful masters, by whom they were openly intimidated.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it would have been idle
for the crown to have expected aid from a body of men
who themselves had no influence, and whose scanty
privileges existed only on sufferance. But there was
another class, which was extremely powerful, and to
which the Scotch kings naturally turned. That class
was the clergy; and the interest which both parties
had in weakening the nobles, caused a coalition between
the church and the throne, against the aristocracy.
During a long period, and indeed until the latter half
of the sixteenth century, the kings almost invariably
favoured the clergy, and increased their privileges in
every way they could. The Reformation dissolved
this alliance, and gave rise to new combinations, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
I shall presently indicate. But while the alliance
lasted, it was of great use to the clergy, by imparting
to their claims a legitimate sanction, and making them
appear the supporters of order and of regular government.
The result, however, clearly proved that the
nobles were more than equal to the confederacy which
opposed them. Indeed, looking at their enormous
power, the only wonder is, that the clergy could have
prolonged the contest as they did; since they were not
actually overthrown until the year 1560. That the
struggle should have been so arduous, and should have
extended over so considerable a period, is what, on a
superficial view, no one could have expected. The
reason of this, I shall now endeavour to explain; and
I shall, I trust, succeed in proving, that in Scotland
there was a long train of general causes, which secured
to the spiritual classes immense influence, and which
enabled them, not only to do battle with the most
powerful aristocracy in Europe, but to rise up, after
what seemed their final defeat, fresh and vigorous
as ever, and eventually to exercise, as Protestant
preachers, an authority nowise inferior to that which
they had wielded as Catholic priests.</p>

<p>Of all Protestant countries, Scotland is certainly
the one where the course of affairs has for the longest
period been most favourable to the interests of superstition.
How these interests were encouraged during
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, I shall hereafter
relate. At present, I purpose to examine the
causes of their early growth, and to show the way in
which they were not only connected with the Reformation,
but gave to that great event some peculiarities
which are extremely remarkable, and are diametrically
opposed to what happened in England.</p>

<p>If the reader will bear in mind what I have elsewhere
stated,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> he will remember that the two principal
sources of superstition are ignorance and danger;
ignorance keeping men unacquainted with natural
causes, and danger making them recur to supernatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
ones. Or, to express the same proposition in other
words, the feeling of veneration, which, under one of
its aspects, takes the form of superstition, is a product
of wonder and of fear;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and it is obvious that wonder
is connected with ignorance, and that fear is connected
with danger.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Hence it is, that whatever in any
country increases the total amount of amazement, or
whatever in any country increases the total amount
of peril, has a direct tendency to increase the total
amount of superstition, and therefore to strengthen the
hands of the priesthood.</p>

<p>By applying these principles to Scotland, we shall
be able to explain several facts in the history of that
country. In the first place the features of its scenery
offer a mark contrast to those of England, and are
much more likely, among an ignorant people, to
suggest effective and permanent superstitions. The
storms and the mists, the darkened sky flashed by
frequent lightning, the peals of thunder reverberating
from mountain to mountain, and echoing on every side,
the dangerous hurricanes, the gusts sweeping the innumerable
lakes with which the country is studded,
the rolling and impetuous torrent flooding the path of
the traveller and stopping his progress, are strangely
different to those safer and milder phenomena, among
which the English people have developed their prosperity,
and built up their mighty cities. Even the
belief in witchcraft, one of the blackest superstitions
which has ever defaced the human mind, has been
affected by these peculiarities; and it has been well
observed, that while, according to the old English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
creed, the witch was a miserable and decrepit hag,
the slave rather than the mistress of the demons
which haunted her, she, in Scotland, rose to the
dignity of a potent sorcerer, who mastered the evil
spirit, and, forcing it to do her will, spread among the
people a far deeper and more lasting terror.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar results were produced by the incessant and
sanguinary wars to which Scotland was exposed, and
especially by the cruel ravages of the English in the
fourteenth century. Whatever religion may be in the
ascendant, the influence of its ministers is invariably
strengthened by a long and dangerous war, the uncertainties
of which perplex the minds of men, and induce
them, when natural resources are failing, to call on the
supernatural for help. On such occasions, the clergy
rise in importance; the churches are more than usually
filled; and the priest, putting himself forward as the
exponent of the wishes of God, assumes the language
of authority, and either comforts the people under
their losses in a righteous cause, or else explains to
them that those losses are sent as a visitation for their
sins, and as a warning that they have not been sufficiently
attentive to their religious duties; in other
words, that they have neglected rites and ceremonies,
in the performance of which the priest himself has a
personal interest.</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, that in the fourteenth century,
when the sufferings of Scotland were at their height,
the clergy flourished more than ever; so that as the
country became poorer, the spiritual classes became
richer in proportion to the rest of the nation. Even in
the fifteenth, and first half of the sixteenth century,
when industry began somewhat to advance, we are
assured that notwithstanding the improvement in the
position of laymen, the whole of their wealth put together,
and including the possessions of all ranks, was
barely equal to the wealth of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
hierarchy were so rapacious and so successful during a
period of comparative security, it would be difficult to
overrate the enormous harvest they must have reaped
in those earlier days, when danger being much more
imminent, hardly any one died without leaving something
to them; all being anxious to testify their respect
towards those who knew more than their fellows, and
whose prayers could either avert present evil, or secure
future happiness.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Another consequence of these protracted wars was,
that a more than ordinary proportion of the population
embraced the ecclesiastical profession, because in it
alone there was some chance of safety: and the monasteries
in particular were crowded with persons who
hoped, though frequently in vain, to escape from the
burnings and slaughterings to which Scotland was
exposed. When the country, in the fifteenth century,
began to recover from the effects of these ravages, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
absence of manufactures and of commerce, made the
Church the best avenue to wealth;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> so that it was
entered by peaceful men for the purpose of security,
and by ambitious men as the surest means of achieving
distinction.</p>

<p>Thus it was, that the want of great cities, and of
that form of industry which belongs to them, made the
spiritual classes more numerous than they would otherwise
have been; and what is very observable is, that
it not only increased their number, but also increased
the disposition of the people to obey them. Agriculturists
are naturally, and by the very circumstances of
their daily life, more superstitious than manufacturers,
because the events with which they deal are more
mysterious, that is to say, more difficult to generalize
and predict.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Hence it is, that, as a body, the inhabitants
of agricultural districts pay greater respect to the
teachings of their clergy than the inhabitants of manufacturing
districts. The growth of cities has, therefore,
been a main cause of the decline of ecclesiastical power;
and the fact that, until the eighteenth century, Scotland
had nothing worthy of being called a city, is one of
many circumstances which explain the prevalence of
Scotch superstition, and the inordinate influence of the
Scotch clergy.</p>

<p>To this, we must add another consideration of great
moment. Partly from the structure of the country,
partly from the weakness of the Crown, and partly from
the necessity of being constantly in arms to repel
foreign invaders, the predatory habits incidental to an
early state of society were encouraged, and consequently
the reign of ignorance was prolonged. Little was
studied, and nothing was known. Until the fifteenth
century, there was not even an university in Scotland,
the first having been founded at St. Andrews in 1412.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
The nobles, when they were not making war upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
enemy, occupied themselves in cutting each other's
throats, and stealing each other's cattle.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Such was
their ignorance, that, even late in the fourteenth century,
there is said to be no instance of a Scotch baron
being able to sign his own name.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> And as nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
approaching to a middle class had been yet formed, we
may from this gain some idea of the amount of knowledge
possessed by the people at large.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Their minds
must have been immersed in a darkness which we can
now barely conceive. No trades, or arts, being practised
which required skill, or dexterity, there was
nothing to exercise their intellects. They consequently
remained so stupid and brutal, that an intelligent
observer, who visited Scotland in the year 1360, likens
them to savages, so much was he struck by their barbarism
and their unsocial manners.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Another writer,
early in the fifteenth century, uses the same expression;
and classing them with the animals which they tended,
he declares that Scotland is fuller of savages than of
cattle.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>By this combination of events, and by this union of
ignorance with danger, the clergy had, in the fifteenth
century, obtained more influence in Scotland than in
any other European country, Spain alone excepted.
And as the power of the nobles had increased quite as
rapidly, it was natural that the Crown, completely
overshadowed by the great barons, should turn for aid
to the Church. During the fifteenth century, and part
of the sixteenth, this alliance was strictly preserved;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
and the political history of Scotland is the history of
a struggle by the kings and the clergy against the
enormous authority of the nobles. The contest, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
lasting about a hundred and sixty years, was brought to
a close in 1560, by the triumph of the aristocracy, and
the overthrow of the Church. With such force, however,
had the circumstance just narrated, engrained superstition
into the Scotch character, that the spiritual
classes quickly rallied, and, under their new name of
Protestants, they became as formidable as under their
old name of Catholics. Forty-three years after the establishment
of the Reformation in Scotland, James VI.
ascended the throne of England, and was able to array
the force of the southern country against the refractory
barons of the northern. From that moment the Scotch
aristocracy began to decline; and the equipoise to the
clergy being removed, the Church became so powerful,
that, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
it was the most effectual obstacle to the progress of
Scotland; and even now it exercises a sway which is
incomprehensible to those who have not carefully studied
the whole chain of its antecedents. To trace with
minuteness the long course of affairs which has led to
this unfortunate result, would be incompatible with
the object of an Introduction, whose only aim it is to
establish broad and general principles. But, to bring
the question clearly before the mind of the reader, it will
be necessary that I should give a slight sketch of the
relation which the nobles bore to the clergy in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and of the way in
which their relative positions, and their implacable
hatred of each other, brought about the Reformation.
By this means, we shall perceive, that the great Protestant
movement, which, in other countries, was
democratic, was in Scotland aristocratic. We shall
also see, that, in Scotland, the Reformation, not being
the work of the people, has never produced the effects
which might have been expected from it, and which it
did produce in England. It is, indeed, but too evident,
that, while in England Protestantism has diminished
superstition, has weakened the clergy, has increased
toleration, and, in a word, has secured the triumph of
secular interests over ecclesiastical ones, its result in
Scotland has been entirely different; and that, in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
country, the Church, changing its form, without altering
its spirit, not only cherished its ancient pretensions,
but unhappily retained its ancient power; and that,
although that power is now dwindling away, the Scotch
preachers still exhibit, whenever they dare, an insolent
and domineering spirit, which shows how much real
weakness there yet lurks in the nation, where such
extravagant claims are not immediately silenced by the
voice of loud and general ridicule.</p>

<p>The history of the improvement of the roads during the latter half of
the eighteenth century, has never been written; but it is of the
greatest importance for its intellectual results, in causing national
fusion, as well as for its economical results, in helping trade. Some
idea may be formed of the extraordinary energy displayed by Scotland in
this matter, by comparing the following passages: <i>Chalmers' Caledonia</i>,

sense of including all Scotland from the Pentland Firth to the beginning

<p>Aberdeen, being richer, was more tempting, but was likewise more able to
defend itself. Still, its burgh records supply curious evidence of the
constant fear in which the citizens lived, and of the precautions which
they took to ward off the attacks, sometimes of the English, and
sometimes of the clans. See the <i>Council Register of Aberdeen</i>
(published by the Spalding Club, Aberdeen, 1844&ndash;1848, 4to), vol. i. pp.
8, 19, 60, 83, 197, 219, 232, 268, vol. ii. p. 82. The last entry, which

I have met with so many proofs of the great accuracy of this valuable
work, that I should be loath to question any statement made by Mr.
Chambers, when, as in this case, I have only my memory to trust to. But
I think that I have seen evidence of paper being successfully
manufactured in Scotland late in the seventeenth century, though I
cannot recall the passages. However, Arnot, in his <i>History of
Edinburgh</i>, p. 599, edit. 4to, says, &lsquo;About forty years ago, printing or
writing paper began to be manufactured in Scotland. Before that, papers
were imported from Holland, or brought from England,&rsquo; As Arnot's work
was printed in 1788, this coincides with Mr. Chambers' statement. I may
add, that, at the end of the eighteenth century, there were &lsquo;two
paper-mills near Perth.&rsquo; <i>Heron's Journey through Scotland</i>, vol. i. p.

deaths occurred in the year. An annual mortality of 1 in 40 would be a
very favourable estimate; indeed, rather too favourable, considering the
habits of the people at that time. However, supposing it to be 1 in 40,
the population would be 2880; and if, as I make no doubt, the mortality
was more than 1 in 40, the population must of course have been less.
Kennedy, in his valuable, but very uncritical, work, conjectures that
&lsquo;one fiftieth part of the inhabitants had died annually;&rsquo; though it is
certain that there was no town in Europe any thing like so
healthy as that. On this hypothesis, which is contradicted by every sort
of statistical evidence that has come down to us, the number would be 72

&lsquo;&ldquo;Quel diable les a mandés? Ne savons-nous pas bien faire notre guerre
sans eux aux Anglois? Nous ne ferons jà bonne besogne tant comme ils
soient avec nous. On leur dise que ils s'en revoisent, et que nous
sommes gens assez en Escosse pour parmaintenir notre guerre, et que
point nous ne voulons leur compagnie. Ils ne nous entendent point, ni
nous eux; nous ne savons parler ensemble; ils auront tantôt riflé et
mangé tout ce qui est en ce pays: ils nous feront plus de contraires, de
dépits, et de dommages, si nous les laissons convenir, que les Anglois
ne feroient si ils s'étoient embattus entre nous sans ardoir. Et si les
Anglois ardent nos maisons, que peut il chaloir? Nous les aurons tantôt
refaites à bon marché, nous n'y mettons au refaire que trois jours, mais
que nous ayons quatre ou six estaches et de la ramée pour lier par
dessus.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ainsi disoient les Escots en Escosse à la venue des seigneurs de
France,&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Et quand les Anglois y chevauchent ou que ils y vont,
ainsi que ils y ont été plusieurs fois, il convient que leurs
pourvéances, si ils veulent vivre, les suivent toujours au dos; car on
ne trouve rien sur le pays: à grand'peine y recuevre-l'en du fer pour
serrer les chevaux, ni du cuir pour faire harnois, selles ni brides. Les
choses toutes faites leur viennent par mer de Flandre, et quand cela
leur défaut, ils n'ont nulle chose. Quand ces barons et ces chevaliers
de France qui avoient appris ces beaux hôtels à trouver, ces salles
parées, ces chasteaux et ces bons mols lits pour reposer, se virent
et trouvèrent en celle povreté, si commencèrent à rire et à dire: &ldquo;En
quel pays nous a ci amenés l'amiral? Nous ne sçumes oncques que ce fût
de povreté ni de dureté fors maintenant.&rdquo;&rsquo; <i>Les Chroniques de
Froissart</i>, edit. Buchon, Paris, 1835, vol. ii. pp. 314, 315. &lsquo;The
hovels of the common people were slight erections of turf, or twigs,
which, as they were often laid waste by war, were built merely for
temporary accommodation. Their towns consisted chiefly of wooden
cottages,&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Even as late as 1600, the houses of Edinburgh were
chiefly built of wood.&rsquo; <i>Chalmers' Caledonia</i>, vol. i. p. 802. Another
account, written in 1670, says, &lsquo;The houses of the commonalty are very
mean, mudwall and thatch, the best; but the poorer sort live in such
miserable huts as never eye beheld.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;In some parts, where turf is
plentiful, they build up little cabbins thereof, with arched roofs of
turf, without a stick of timber in it; when the house is dry enough to
burn, it serves them for fuel, and they remove to another.&rsquo; <i>Harleian

people, who had small stocks, and were of no reputation. These were, for
the most part, workmen for home-consumpt, such as masons,
house-carpenters, armourers, blacksmiths, taylors, shoemakers, and the
like. Our weavers were few in number, and in the greatest contempt, as
their employments were more sedentary, and themselves reckoned less fit
for war, in which all were obliged to serve, when the exigencies of the
country demanded their attendance.&rsquo; <i>The Interest of Scotland
Considered</i>, Edinburgh, 1733, p. 82. Pinkerton (<i>History of Scotland</i>,
vol. ii. p. 392), referring to the Sloane manuscripts, says, &lsquo;The author
of an interesting memoir concerning the state of Scotland about 1590,
observes, that the husbandmen were a kind of slaves, only holding their
lands from year to year; that the nobility being too numerous for the
extent of the country, there arose too great an inequality of rank and
revenue; and there was no middle station between a proud landholder and
those who, having no property to lose, were ready for any tumult. A rich
yeomanry, numerous merchants and tradesmen of property, and all the
denominations of the middle class, so important in a flourishing
society, were long to be confined to England.&rsquo; Thirteen years later, we
are told that the manufactures of Scotland &lsquo;were confined to a few of
the coarsest nature, without which the poorest nations are unable to
subsist.&rsquo; <i>Laing's History of Scotland</i>, vol. iii. p. 7, under the year

under the shelter of the castle of the same name.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Dunbar became
the town, in demesn, of the successive Earls of Dunbar and March,
partaking of their influences, whether unfortunate or happy.&rsquo; <i>Chalmers'
Caledonia</i>, vol. ii. p. 416. &lsquo;But when the regal government became at
any time feeble, these towns, unequal to their own protection, placed
themselves under the shelter of the most powerful lord in their
neighbourhood. Thus, the town of Elgyn found it necessary, at various
periods between the years 1389 and 1452, to accept of many charters of
protection, and discharges of taxes, from the Earls of Moray, who held
it in some species of vassalage.&rsquo; <i>Sinclair's Scotland</i>, vol. v. p. 3.

Sometimes the nobles did not leave to the citizens even the appearance
of a free election, but fought it out among themselves. An instance of
this happened at Perth, in 1544, &lsquo;where a claim for the office of
provost was decided by arms, between Lord Ruthven on the one side,
supported by a numerous train of his vassals, and Lord Gray, with Norman
Leslie, master of Rothes, and Charteris of Kinfauns, on the other.&rsquo;

1st edit., a spirited description of Scotland in 1639. &lsquo;The parliament
of the northern kingdom was a very different body from that which bore
the same name in England.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The three estates sat in one house. The
commissioners of the burghs were considered merely as retainers of the
great nobles,&rsquo; &amp;c. To come down much later, Lord Cockburn gives a
terrible account of the state of things in Scotland in 1794, the year in
which Jeffrey was called to the bar. &lsquo;There was then, in this country,
no popular representation, no emancipated burghs, no effective rival of
the established church, no independent press, no free public meetings,
and no better trial by jury, even in political cases (except high
treason), than what was consistent with the circumstances, that the
jurors were not sent into court under any impartial rule, and that, when
in court, those who were to try the case were named by the presiding
judge. The Scotch representatives were only forty-five, of whom thirty
were elected for counties, and fifteen for towns. Both from its price
and its nature (being enveloped in feudal and technical absurdities),
the elective franchise in counties, where alone it existed, was far
above the reach of the whole lower, and of a great majority of the
middle, and of many even of the higher, ranks. There were probably not
above 1500 or 2000 county electors in all Scotland; a body not too large
to be held, hope included, in government's hands. The return, therefore,
of a single opposition member was never to be expected.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Of the
fifteen town members, Edinburgh returned one. The other fourteen were
produced by clusters of four or five unconnected burghs electing each
one delegate, and these four or five delegates electing the
representative. Whatever this system may have been originally, it had
grown, in reference to the people, into as complete a mockery as if it
had been invented for their degradation. The people had nothing to do
with it. It was all managed by town-councils, of never more than
thirty-three members; and every town-council was self-elected, and
consequently perpetuated its own interests. The election of either the
town or the county member was a matter of such utter indifference to the
people, that they often only knew of it by the ringing of a bell, or by
seeing it mentioned next day in a newspaper; for the farce was generally
performed in an apartment from which, if convenient, the public could be
excluded, and never in the open air.&rsquo; <i>Cockburn's Life of Jeffrey</i>,

representation between this and the Reform Bill, compare <i>Irving's

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> We must discriminate between wonder and admiration. Wonder
is the product of ignorance; admiration is the product of knowledge.
Ignorance wonders at the supposed irregularities of nature; science
admires its uniformities. The earlier writers rarely attended to this
distinction, because they were misled by the etymology of the word
&lsquo;admiration.&rsquo; The Romans were very superficial thinkers upon all matters
except jurisprudence; and their blundering use of &lsquo;admirari&rsquo; gave rise
to the error, so common among our old writers, of &lsquo;I admire,&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;I wonder.&rsquo;</p></div>

supernatural coadjutor on the south side of the Tweed. She sometimes
seems to rise from the proper sphere of the witch, who is only the
slave, into that of the sorcerer, who is master of the demon.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;In a
people so far behind their neighbours in domestic organization, poor and
hardy, inhabiting a country of mountains, torrents, and rocks, where
cultivation was scanty, accustomed to gloomy mists and wild storms,
every impression must necessarily assume a corresponding character.
Superstitions, like funguses and vermin, are existences peculiar to the
spot where they appear, and are governed by its physical accidents.&rsquo; &hellip;
&lsquo;And thus it is that the indications of witchcraft in Scotland are as
different from those of the superstition which in England receives the
same name, as the Grampian Mountains from Shooter's Hill or Kennington
Common.&rsquo; <i>Burton's Criminal Trials in Scotland</i>, vol. i. pp. 240&ndash;243.
This is admirably expressed, and exhausts the general view of the
subject. The relation between the superstition of the Scotch and the
physical aspects of their country is also touched upon, though with much
inferior ability, in <i>Brown's History of the Highlands</i>, vol. i. p. 106,
and in <i>Sinclair's Scotland</i>, vol. iv. p. 560. Hume, in his
<i>Commentaries on the Laws of Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 556, has an
interesting passage on the high pretensions of Scotch witchcraft, which
never degenerated, as in other countries, into a mere attempt at
deception, but always remained a sturdy and deep-rooted belief. He says,
&lsquo;For among the many trials for witchcraft which fill the record, I have
not observed that there is even one which proceeds upon the notion of a
vain or cheating art, falsely used by an impostor to deceive the weak
and credulous.&rsquo; Further information respecting Scotch witchcraft will be

was more munificently endowed, considering the extent and resources of
the kingdom, than it was in any other country in Europe.&rsquo; <i>Lawson's

those who called themselves his servants.&rsquo; <i>History of Scotland</i>, book

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">CONDITION OF SCOTLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES.</div>

<p>Early in the fifteenth century, the alliance between
the Crown and the Church, and the determination of
that alliance to overthrow the nobles, became manifest.
Indications of this may be traced in the policy of Albany,
who was Regent from 1406 to 1419, and who made it
his principal object to encourage and strengthen the
clergy.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He also dealt the first great blow upon which
any government had ventured against the aristocracy.
Donald, who was one of the most powerful of the Scottish
chieftains, and who, indeed, by the possession of
the Western Isles, was almost an independent prince,
had seized the earldom of Ross, which, if he could have
retained, would have enabled him to set the Crown at
defiance. Albany, backed by the Church, marched into
his territories, in 1411, forced him to renounce the earldom,
to make personal submission, and to give hostages
for his future conduct.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> So vigorous a proceeding on
the part of the executive, was extremely unusual in
Scotland;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and it was the first of a series of aggressions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
which ended in the Crown obtaining for itself, not
only Ross, but also the Western Isles.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The policy
inaugurated by Albany, was followed up with still
greater energy by James I. In 1424, this bold and
active prince procured an enactment, obliging many of
the nobles to show their charters, in order that it might
be ascertained what lands they held, which had formerly
belonged to the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> And, to conciliate the affections
of the clergy, he, in 1425, issued a commission,
authorizing the Bishop of Saint Andrews to restore to
the Church whatever had been alienated from it; while
he at the same time directed that the justiciaries should
assist in enforcing execution of the decree.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This occurred
in June; and what shows that it was part of a
general scheme is, that in the preceding spring, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
king suddenly arrested, in the parliament assembled at
Perth, upwards of twenty of the principal nobles, put
four of them to death, and confiscated several of their
estates.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Two years afterwards, he, with equal perfidy,
summoned the Highland chiefs to meet him at Inverness,
laid hands on them also, executed three, and
imprisoned more than forty, in different parts of the
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>By these measures, and by supporting the Church
with the same zeal that he attacked the nobles, the king
thought to reverse the order of affairs hitherto established,
and to secure the supremacy of the throne over
the aristocracy.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> But herein, he overrated his own
power. Like nearly all politicians, he exaggerated the
value of political remedies. The legislator and the
magistrate may, for a moment, palliate an evil; they
can never work a cure. General mischiefs depend upon
general causes, and these are beyond their art. The
symptoms of the disease they can touch, while the
disease itself baffles their efforts, and is too often exasperated
by their treatment. In Scotland, the power of
the nobles was a cruel malady, which preyed on the
vitals of the nation; but it had long been preparing; it
was a chronic disorder; and, having worked into the
general habit, it might be removed by time, it could
never be diminished by violence. On the contrary, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
this, as in all matters, whenever politicians attempt
great good, they invariably inflict great harm. Over-action
on one side produces reaction on the other, and
the balance of the fabric is disturbed. By the shock of
conflicting interests, the scheme of life is made insecure.
New animosities are kindled, old ones are embittered,
and the natural jar and discordance are aggravated,
simply because the rulers of mankind cannot be brought
to understand, that, in dealing with a great country,
they have to do with an organization so subtle, so
extremely complex, and withal so obscure, as to make it
highly probable, that whatever they alter in it, they
will alter wrongly, and that while their efforts to protect
or to strengthen its particular parts are extremely
hazardous, it does undoubtedly possess within itself a
capacity of repairing its injuries, and that to bring
such capacity into play, there is merely required that
time and freedom which the interference of powerful
men too often prevents it from enjoying.</p>

<p>Thus it was in Scotland, in the fifteenth century.
The attempts of James I. failed, because they were particular
measures directed against general evils. Ideas
and associations, generated by a long course of events,
and deeply seated in the public mind, had given to
the aristocracy immense power; and if every noble in
Scotland had been put to death, if all their castles had
been razed to the ground, and all their estates confiscated,
the time would unquestionably have come, when
their successors would have been more influential than
ever, because the affection of their retainers and dependents
would be increased by the injustice that had
been perpetrated. For, every passion excites its opposite.
Cruelty to-day, produces sympathy to-morrow.
A hatred of injustice contributes more than any other
principle to correct the inequalities of life, and to maintain
the balance of affairs. It is this loathing at tyranny,
which, by stirring to their inmost depth the warmest
feelings of the heart, makes it impossible that tyranny
should ever finally succeed. This, in sooth, is the noble
side of our nature. This is that part of us, which, stamped
with a godlike beauty, reveals its divine origin, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
providing for the most distant contingencies, is our
surest guarantee that violence shall never ultimately
triumph; that, sooner or later, despotism shall always
be overthrown; and that the great and permanent interests
of the human race shall never be injured by the
wicked counsels of unjust men.</p>

<p>In the case of James I., the reaction came sooner
than might have been expected; and, as it happened in
his lifetime, it was a retribution, as well as a reaction.
For some years, he continued to oppress the nobles with
impunity;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> but, in 1436, they turned upon him, and
put him to death, in revenge for the treatment to which
he had subjected many of them.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Their power now
rose as suddenly as it had fallen. In the south of Scotland,
the Douglases were supreme,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and the earl of that
family possessed revenues about equal to those of the
Crown.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> And, to show that his authority was equal
to his wealth, he, on the marriage of James II., in 1449,
appeared at the nuptials with a train composed of five
thousand followers.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> These were his own retainers,
armed and resolute men, bound to obey any command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
he might issue to them. Not, indeed, that compulsion
was needed on the part of a Scotch noble to secure the
obedience of his own people. The servitude was a
willing one, and was essential to the national manners.
Then, and long afterwards, it was discreditable, as well
as unsafe, not to belong to a great clan; and those who
were so unfortunate as to be unconnected with any
leading family, were accustomed to take the name of
some chief, and to secure his protection by devoting
themselves to his service.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>What the Earl of Douglas was in the south of Scotland,
that were the Earls of Crawford and of Ross in
the north.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Singly they were formidable; united they
seemed irresistible. When, therefore, in the middle of
the fifteenth century, they actually leagued together,
and formed a strict compact against all their common
enemies, it was hard to say what limit could be set to
their power, or what resource remained to the government,
except that of sowing disunion among them.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>But, in the mean time, the disposition of the nobles
to use force against the Crown, had been increased by
fresh violence. Government, instead of being warned
by the fate of James I., imitated his unscrupulous acts,
and pursued the very policy which had caused his destruction.
Because the Douglases were the most powerful
of all the great families, it was determined that their
chiefs should be put to death; and because they could
not be slain by force, they were to be murdered by
treachery. In 1440, the Earl of Douglas, a boy of
fifteen, and his brother, who was still younger than he,
were invited to Edinburgh on a friendly visit to the
king. Scarcely had they arrived, when they were
seized by order of the chancellor, subjected to a mock
trial, declared guilty, dragged to the castle-yard, and
the heads of the poor children cut off.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Considering the warm feelings of attachment which
the Scotch entertained for their chiefs, it is difficult to
overrate the consequences of this barbarous murder, in
strengthening a class it was hoped to intimidate. But
this horrible crime was committed by the government
only, and it occurred during the king's minority: the
next assassination was the work of the king himself.
In 1452, the Earl of Douglas<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> was, with great show of
civility, requested by James II. to repair to the court
then assembled at Stirling. The Earl hesitated, but
James overcame his reluctance by sending to him a safeconduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with the royal signature, and issued under the
great seal.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The honour of the king being pledged,
the fears of Douglas were removed. He hastened to
Stirling, where he was received with every distinction.
The evening of his arrival, the king, after supper was
over, broke out into reproaches against him, and, suddenly
drawing his dagger, stabbed him. Gray then
struck him with a battle-axe, and he fell dead on the
floor, in presence of his sovereign, who had lured him
to court, that he might murder him with impunity.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The ferocity of the Scotch character, which was the
natural result of the ignorance and poverty of the
nation, was, no doubt, one cause, and a very important
one, of the commission of such crimes as these, not
secretly, but in the open light of day, and by the
highest men in the State. It cannot, however, be
denied, that another cause was, the influence of the
clergy, whose interest it was to humble the nobles, and
who were by no means scrupulous as to the means
that they employed.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> As the Crown became more
alienated from the aristocracy, it united itself still
closer with the Church. In 1443, a statute was enacted,
the object of which was, to secure ecclesiastical property
from the attacks made upon it by the nobles.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
And although, in that state of society, it was easier to
pass laws than to execute them, such a measure indicated
the general policy of the government, and the
union between it and the Church. Indeed, as to this,
no one could be mistaken.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> For nearly twenty years,
the avowed and confidential adviser of the Crown was
Kennedy, bishop of Saint Andrews, who retained power
until his death, in 1466, during the minority of
James III.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> He was the bitter enemy of the nobles,
against whom he displayed an unrelenting spirit, which
was sharpened by personal injuries; for the Earl of
Crawford had plundered his lands, and the Earl of Douglas
had attempted to seize him, and had threatened to
put him into irons.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The mildest spirit might well
have been roused by this; and as James II., when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
assassinated Douglas, was more influenced by Kennedy
than by any one else, it is probable that the
bishop was privy to that foul transaction. At all
events, he expressed no disapprobation of it; and
when, in consequence of the murder, the Douglases
and their friends rose in open rebellion, Kennedy gave
to the king a crafty and insidious counsel, highly characteristic
of the cunning of his profession. Taking
up a bundle of arrows, he showed James, that when
they were together, they were not to be broken;
but that, if separated, they were easily destroyed.
Hence he inferred, that the aristocracy should be overthrown
by disuniting the nobles, and ruining them one
by one.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>In this he was right, so far as the interests of his own
order were concerned; but, looking at the interest of
the nation, it is evident that the power of the nobles, notwithstanding
their gross abuse of it, was, on the whole,
beneficial, since it was the only barrier against despotism.
The evil they actually engendered, was indeed
immense. But they kept off other evils, which would
have been worse. By causing present anarchy, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
secured future liberty. For, as there was no middle
class, there were only three orders in the commonwealth;
namely, government, clergy, and nobles. The
two first being united against the last, it is certain that
if they had won the day, Scotland would have been oppressed
by the worst of all yokes, to which a country
can be subjected. It would have been ruled by an
absolute king and an absolute Church, who, playing
into each other's hands, would have tyrannized over a
people, who, though coarse and ignorant, still loved a
certain rude and barbarous liberty, which it was good
for them to possess, but which, in the face of such a
combination, they would most assuredly have forfeited.</p>

<p>Happily, however, the power of the nobles was too
deeply rooted in the popular mind to allow of this
catastrophe. In vain did James III. exert himself
to discourage them,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and to elevate their rivals, the
clergy.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Nothing could shake their authority; and,
in 1482, they, seeing the determination of the king,
assembled together, and such was their influence over
their followers, that they had no difficulty in seizing
his person, and imprisoning him in the Castle of
Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> After his liberation, fresh quarrels arose;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and in 1488, the principal nobles collected troops, met
him in the field, defeated him, and put him to death.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
He was succeeded by James IV., under whom the
course of affairs was exactly the same; that is to say,
on one side the nobles, and on the other side the Crown
and the Church. Every thing that the king could do
to uphold the clergy, he did cheerfully. In 1493, he
obtained an act to secure the immunities of the sees of
Saint Andrews and of Glasgow, the two most important
in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In 1503, he procured a general
revocation of all grants and gifts prejudicial to the
Church, whether they had been made by the Parliament
or by the Council.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> And, in 1508, he, by the
advice of Elphinston, bishop of Aberdeen, ventured on
a measure of still greater boldness. That able and
ambitious prelate induced James to revive against the
nobility several obsolete claims, by virtue of which the
king could, under certain circumstances, take possession
of their estates, and could, in every instance in
which the owner held of the Crown, receive nearly
the whole of the proceeds during the minority of the
proprietor.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>To make such claims was easy; to enforce them
was impossible. Indeed, the nobles were at this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
rather gaining ground than losing it; and, after the
death of James IV., in 1513, they, during the
minority of James V., became so powerful, that the
regent, Albany, twice threw up the government in
despair, and at length abandoned it altogether.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> He
finally quitted Scotland in 1524, and with him the
authority of the executive seemed to have vanished.
The Douglases soon obtained possession of the person
of the king, and compelled Beaton, archbishop of
Saint Andrews, the most influential man in the Church,
to resign the office of chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The whole command
now fell into their hands; they or their adherents
filled every office; secular interests predominated,
and the clergy were thrown completely into the
shade.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> In 1528, however, an event occurred by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
which the spiritual classes not only recovered their
former position, but gained a preëminence, which, as
it turned out, was eventually fatal to themselves.
Archbishop Beaton, impatient at proceedings so unfavourable
to the Church, organized a conspiracy, by
means of which James effected his escape from the
Douglases, and took refuge in the castle of Stirling.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
This sudden reaction was not the real and controlling
cause, but it was undoubtedly the proximate cause, of
the establishment of Protestantism in Scotland. For,
the reins of government now passed into the hands of
the Church; and the most influential of the nobles
were consequently persecuted, and some of them driven
from the country. But, though their political power
was gone, their social power remained. They were
stripped of their honours and their wealth. They
became outcasts, traitors, and beggars. Still, the real
foundation of their authority was unshaken, because
that authority was the result of a long train of circumstances,
and was based on the affections of the people.
Therefore it was, that the nobles, even those who were
exiled and attainted, were able to conduct an arduous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
but eventually a successful, struggle against their
enemies. The desire of revenge whetted their exertions,
and gave rise to a deadly contest between the
Scotch aristocracy and the Scotch Church. This most
remarkable conflict was, in some degree, a continuation
of that which began early in the fifteenth century.
But it was far more bitter; it lasted, without interruption,
for thirty-two years; and it was only concluded
by the triumph of the nobles, who, in 1560, completely
overthrew the Church, and destroyed, almost at a blow,
the whole of the Scotch hierarchy.</p>

<p>The events of this struggle, and the vicissitudes to
which, during its continuance, both parties were exposed,
are related, though somewhat confusedly, in our
common histories: it will be sufficient if I indicate
the salient points, and, avoiding needless detail, endeavour
to throw light on the general movement.
The unity of the entire scheme will thus be brought
before our minds, and we shall see, that the destruction
of the Catholic Church was its natural consummation,
and that the last act of that gorgeous drama,
so far from being a strained and irregular sequence,
was in fit keeping with the whole train of the preceding
plot.</p>

<p>When James effected his escape in 1528, he was a
boy of sixteen, and his policy, so far as he can be said
to have had any mind of his own, was of course determined
by the clergy, to whom he owed his liberty,
and who were his natural protectors. His principal
adviser was the Archbishop of Saint Andrews; and
the important post of chancellor, which, under the
Douglases, had been held by a layman, was now conferred
on the Archbishop of Glasgow.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> These two
prelates were supreme; while, at the same time, the
Abbot of Holyrood was made treasurer, and the
Bishop of Dunkeld was made privy seal.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> All nobles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and even all followers, of the house of Douglas, were
forbidden to approach within twelve miles of the court,
under pain of treason.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> An expedition was fitted
out, and sent against the Earl of Caithness, who was
defeated and slain.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Just before this occurred, the
Earl of Angus was driven out of Scotland, and his
estates confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> An act of attainder was passed
against the Douglases.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The government, moreover,
seized, and threw into prison, the Earl of Bothwell,
Home, Maxwell, and two Kerrs, and the barons of
Buccleuch, Johnston, and Polwarth.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>All this was vigorous enough, and was the consequence
of the Church recovering her power. Other
measures, equally decisive, were preparing. In 1531,
the king deprived the Earl of Crawford of most of his
estates, and threw the Earl of Argyle into prison.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Even those nobles who had been inclined to follow him,
he now discouraged. He took every opportunity of
treating them with coldness, while he filled the highest
offices with their rivals, the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Finally, he, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
1532, aimed a deadly blow at their order, by depriving
them of a large part of the jurisdiction which they
were wont to exercise in their own country, and to the
possession of which they owed much of their power.
At the instigation of the Archbishop of Glasgow, he
established what was called the College of Justice, in
which suits were to be decided, instead of being tried,
as heretofore, by the barons, at home, in their castles.
It was ordered that this new tribunal should consist of
fifteen judges, eight of whom must be ecclesiastics; and
to make the intention still more clear, it was provided
that the president should invariably be a clergyman.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>This gave the finishing touch to the whole, and it,
taken in connexion with previous measures, exasperated
the nobles almost to madness. Their hatred
of the clergy became uncontrollable; and, in their
eagerness for revenge, they not only threw themselves
into the arms of England, and maintained a secret
understanding with Henry VIII., but many of them
went even further, and showed a decided leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
towards the principles of the Reformation. As the
enmity between the aristocracy and the Church grew
more bitter, just in the same proportion did the desire
to reform the Church become more marked. The love
of innovation was encouraged by interested motives,
until, in the course of a few years, an immense majority
of the nobles adopted extreme Protestant opinions;
hardly caring what heresy they embraced, so long as
they were able, by its aid, to damage a Church from
which they had recently received the greatest injuries,
and with which they and their progenitors had been
engaged in a contest of nearly a hundred and fifty
years.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time, James V. united himself closer than
ever with the hierarchy. In 1534, he gratified the
Church, by personally assisting at the trial of some
heretics, who were brought before the bishops and
burned.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The next year, he was offered, and he
willingly accepted, the title of Defender of the Faith,
which was transferred to him from Henry VIII.; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
king being supposed to have forfeited it by his impiety.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
At all events, James well deserved it. He was
a stanch supporter of the Church, and his privy-council
was chiefly composed of ecclesiastics, as he
deemed it dangerous to admit laymen to too large a
share in the government.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> And, in 1538, he still
further signalized his policy, by taking for his second
wife Mary of Guise; thus establishing an intimate relation
with the most powerful Catholic family in Europe,
whose ambition, too, was equal to their power, and who
made it their avowed object to uphold the Catholic
faith, and to protect it from those rude and unmannerly
invasions which were now directed against it in most
parts of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>This was hailed by the Church as a guarantee for
the intentions of the king. And so indeed it proved
to be. David Beaton, who negotiated the marriage,
became the chief adviser of James during the rest of
his reign. He was made Archbishop of Saint Andrews
in 1539,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and, by his influence, a persecution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
hotter than any yet known, was directed against the
Protestants. Many of them escaped into England,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
where they swelled the number of the exiles, who
were waiting till the time was ripe to take a deadly
revenge. They, and their adherents at home, coalesced
with the disaffected nobles, particularly with
the Douglases,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> who were by far the most powerful of
the Scotch aristocracy, and who were connected with
most of the great families, either by old associations,
or by the still closer bond of the interest which they
all had in reducing the power of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>At this juncture, the eyes of men were turned towards
the Douglases, whom Henry VIII. harboured at his
court, and who were now maturing their plans.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
Though they did not yet dare to return to Scotland,
their spies and agents reported to them all that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
done, and preserved their connexions at home. Feudal
covenants, bonds of manrent, and other arrangements,
which, even if illegal, it would have been held disgraceful
to renounce, were in full force; and enabled
the Douglases to rely with confidence on many of the
most powerful nobles, who were, moreover, disgusted
at the predominance of the clergy, and who welcomed
the prospect of any change which was likely to lessen
the authority of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>With such a combination of parties, in a country
where, there being no middle class, the people counted
for nothing, but followed wherever they were led, it is
evident that the success or failure of the Reformation
in Scotland was simply a question of the success or
failure of the nobles. They were bent on revenge. The
only doubt was, as to their being strong enough to
gratify it. Against them, they had the Crown and the
Church. On their side they had the feudal traditions,
the spirit of clanship, the devoted obedience of their innumerable
retainers, and, what was equally important,
that love of names, and of family associations, for which
Scotland is still remarkable, but which, in the sixteenth
century, possessed an influence difficult to exaggerate.</p>

<p>The moment for action was now at hand. In 1540,
the government, completely under the control of the
clergy, caused fresh laws to be enacted against the Protestants,
whose interests were by this time identical
with those of the nobles. By these statutes, no one,
even suspected of heresy, could for the future hold any
office; and all Catholics were forbidden to harbour, or
to show favour to, persons who professed the new opinions.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
The clergy, now flushed with conquest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
greedy for the destruction of their ancient rivals, proceeded
to still farther extremities. So unrelenting was
their malice, that, in that same year, they presented to
James a list containing the names of upwards of three
hundred members of the Scotch aristocracy, whom they
formally accused as heretics, who ought to be put to
death, and whose estates they recommended the king
to confiscate.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>These hot and vindictive men little knew of the storm
which they were evoking, and which was about to burst
on their heads, and cover them and their Church with
confusion. Not that we have reason to believe that a
wiser conduct would have ultimately saved the Scotch
hierarchy. On the contrary, the probability is, that
their fate was sealed; for the general causes which
governed the entire movement had been so long at work,
that, at this period, it would have been hardly possible
to have baffled them. But, even if we admit as certain,
that the Scotch clergy were doomed, it is also certain
that their violence made their fall more grievous, by
exasperating the passions of their adversaries. The
train, indeed, was laid; their enemies had supplied the
materials, and all was ready to explode; but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
themselves who at last applied the match, and sprung
the mine to their own destruction.</p>

<p>In 1542, the nobles, seeing that the Church and the
Crown were bent on their ruin, took the most decisive
step on which they had yet ventured, and peremptorily
refused to obey James in making war upon the English.
They knew that the war in which they were desired to
participate had been fomented by the clergy, with the
twofold object of stopping all communication with the
exiles, and of checking the introduction of heretical
opinions.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Both these intentions they resolved to frustrate,
and, being assembled on the field, they declared
with one voice that they would not invade England.
Threats and persuasions were equally useless. James,
stung with vexation, returned home, and ordered the
army to be disbanded. Scarcely had he retired, when
the clergy attempted to rally the troops, and to induce
them to act against the enemy. A few of the peers,
ashamed at what seemed a cowardly desertion of the
king, appeared willing to march. The rest, however,
refused; and, while they were in this state of doubt
and confusion, the English, taking them unawares, suddenly
fell upon their disorderly ranks, utterly routed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
them, and made a large number prisoners. In this disgraceful
action, ten thousand Scotch troops fled before
three hundred English cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The news being
brought to James, while he was still smarting from the
disobedience of the nobles, was too much for his proud
and sensitive mind. He reeled under the double shock;
a slow fever wasted his strength; he sunk into a long
stupor; and, refusing all comfort, he died in December
1542, leaving the Crown to his infant daughter, Mary,
during whose reign the great contest between the aristocracy
and the Church was to be finally decided.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The influence of the nobles was increased by the
death of James V., and yet more by the bad repute into
which the clergy fell for having instigated a war, of
which the result was so disgraceful.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Their party was
still further strengthened by the exiles, who, as soon as
they heard the glad tidings, prepared to leave England.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Early in 1543, Angus and Douglas returned to Scotland,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
and were soon followed by other nobles, most of
whom professed to be Protestants, though, as the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
clearly proved, their Protestantism was inspired by a
love of plunder and of revenge. The late king had, in
his will, appointed Cardinal Beaton to be guardian of
the queen, and governor of the realm.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Beaton,
though an unprincipled man, was very able, and was
respected as the head of the national church; he being
Archbishop of St. Andrews, and primate of Scotland.
The nobles, however, at once arrested him,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> deprived him
of his regency, and put in his place the Earl of Arran,
who, at this time, affected to be a zealous Protestant,
though, on a fitting occasion, he afterwards changed his
opinions.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Among the supporters of the new creed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
most powerful were the Earl of Angus and the Douglases.
They were now freed from a prescription of
fifteen years; their attainder was reversed, and their
estates and honours were restored to them.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> It was
evident that not only the executive authority, but also
the legislative, had passed from the Church to the
aristocracy. And they, who had the power, were not
sparing in the use of it. Lord Maxwell, one of the
most active of their party, had, like most of them, in
their zeal against the hierarchy, embraced the principles
of the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> In the spring of 1543, he obtained
the sanction of the Earl of Arran, the governor of
Scotland, for a proposal which he made to the Lords
of the Articles, whose business it was to digest the
measures to be brought before Parliament. The proposal
was, that the people should be allowed to read the
Bible in a Scotch or English translation. The clergy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
arrayed all their force against what they rightly deemed
a step full of danger to themselves, as conceding a fundamental
principle of Protestantism. But all was in
vain. The tide had set in, and was not to be turned.
The proposition was adopted by the Lords of the
Articles. On their authority, it was introduced into
Parliament. It was passed. It received the assent of
the government; and, amid the lamentations of the
Church, it was proclaimed, with every formality, at
the market-cross of Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely had the nobles thus attained the upper hand,
when they began to quarrel among themselves. They
were resolved to plunder the Church; but they could
not agree as to how the spoil should be shared. Neither
could they determine as to the best mode of proceeding;
some being in favour of an open and immediate schism,
while others wished to advance cautiously, and to temporize
with their opponents, that they might weaken
the hierarchy by degrees. The more active and zealous
section of the nobles were known as the English party,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
owing to their intimate connexion with Henry VIII.,
from whom many of them received supplies of money.
But, in 1544, war broke out between the two countries,
and the clergy, headed by Archbishop Beaton, roused,
with such success, the old feelings of national hatred
against the English, that the nobles were compelled for
a moment to bend before the storm, and to advocate an
alliance with France. Indeed, it seemed for a few
months as if the Church and aristocracy had forgotten
their old and inveterate hostility, and were about to
unite their strength in one common cause.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>This, however, was but a passing delusion. The
antagonism between the two classes was irreconcilable.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
In the spring of 1545, the leading Protestant nobles
formed a conspiracy to assassinate Archbishop Beaton,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
whom they hated more than any one else, partly because
he was the head of the Church, and partly because he
was the ablest and most unscrupulous of their opponents.
A year, however, elapsed before their purpose could be
effected; and it was not till May 1546, that Lesley, a
young baron, accompanied by the Laird of Grange, and
a few others, burst into Saint Andrews, and murdered
the primate in his own castle.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The horror with which the Church heard of this foul
and barbarous deed,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> maybe easily imagined. But the
conspirators, nothing daunted, and relying on the support
of a powerful party, justified their act, seized the
castle of Saint Andrews, and prepared to defend it to the
last. And in this resolution they were upheld by a
most remarkable man, who now first appeared to public
view, and who, being admirably suited to the age in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
which he lived, was destined to become the most conspicuous
character of those troublous times.</p>

<p>That man was John Knox. To say that he was fearless
and incorruptible, that he advocated with unflinching
zeal what he believed to be the truth, and that he
devoted himself with untiring energy to what he deemed
the highest of all objects, is only to render common
justice to the many noble attributes which he undoubtedly
possessed. But, on the other hand, he was stern,
unrelenting, and frequently brutal; he was not only
callous to human suffering, but he could turn it into a
jest, and employ on it the resources of his coarse, though
exuberant, humour;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and he loved power so inordinately,
that, unable to brook the slightest opposition, he
trampled on all who crossed his path, or stood even for
a moment in the way of his ulterior designs.</p>

<p>The influence of Knox in promoting the Reformation,
has indeed been grossly exaggerated by historians, who
are too apt to ascribe vast results to individual exertions;
overlooking those large and general causes, in the
absence of which the individual exertion would be
fruitless. Still, he effected more than any single man;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
although the really important period of his life, in regard
to Scotland, was in and after 1559, when the triumph of
Protestantism was already secure, and when he reaped
the benefit of what had been effected during his long
absence from his own country. His first effort was a
complete failure, and, more than any one of his actions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
has injured his reputation. This was the sanction
which he gave to the cruel murder of Archbishop
Beaton, in 1546. He repaired to the Castle of Saint
Andrews; he shut himself up with the assassins; he
prepared to share their fate; and, in a work which he
afterwards wrote, openly justified what they had done.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
For this, nothing can excuse him; and it is with a certain
sense of satisfied justice that we learn, that, in
1547, the castle being taken by the French, Knox was
treated with great severity, and was made to work at
the galleys, from which he was not liberated till 1549.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>During the next five years, Knox remained in England,
which he quitted in 1554, and arrived at Dieppe.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
He then travelled abroad; and did not revisit Scotland
till the autumn of 1555, when he was eagerly welcomed
by the principal nobles and their adherents.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> From
some cause, however, which has not been sufficiently
explained, but probably from an unwillingness to play
a subordinate part among those proud chiefs, he, in July
1556, again left Scotland, and repaired to Geneva, where
he had been invited to take charge of a congregation.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
He stayed abroad till 1559, by which time the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
struggle was almost over; so completely had the nobles
succeeded in sapping the foundations of the Church.</p>

<p>For, the course of events having been long prepared,
was now rapid indeed. In 1554, the queen dowager
had succeeded Arran as regent.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> She was that Mary
of Guise whose marriage with James V. we have noticed
as one of the indications of the policy then prevailing.
If left alone, she would probably have done
little harm;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> but her powerful and intolerant family
exhorted her to suppress the heretics, and, as a natural
part of the same scheme, to put down the nobles. By
the advice of her brothers, the Duke of Guise and the
Cardinal of Lorraine, she, in 1555, proposed to establish
a standing army, to supply the place of the troops,
which consisted of the feudal barons and their retainers.
Such a force, being paid by the Crown, would have been
entirely under its control; but the nobles saw the ulterior
design, and compelled Mary to abandon it, on the
ground that they and their vassals were able to defend
Scotland, without further aid.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Her next attempt was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to consolidate the interests of the Catholic party, which
she effected, in 1558, by marrying her daughter to the
dauphin. This increased the influence of the Guises,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
whose niece, already queen of Scotland, would now, in
the ordinary course of affairs, become queen of France.
They urged their sister to extreme measures, and promised
to assist her with French troops. On the other
hand, the nobles remained firm, and prepared for the
struggle. In December 1557, several of them had
drawn up a covenant, agreeing to stand by each other,
and to resist the tyranny with which they were threatened.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
They now took the name of Lords of the
Congregation, and sent forth their agents to secure the
subscriptions of those who wished for a reformation of
the Church.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> They, moreover, wrote to Knox, whose
style of preaching, being very popular, would, they
thought, be useful in stirring up the people to rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
He was then in Geneva, and did not arrive in Scotland
till May 1559,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> by which time the result of the impending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
contest was hardly doubtful, so successful had the
nobles been in strengthening their party, and so much
reason had they to expect the support of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Nine days after Knox entered Scotland, the first blow
was struck. On the 11th of May 1559, he preached in
Perth. After the sermon, a tumult arose, and the people
plundered the churches and pulled down the monasteries.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
The queen-regent, hastily assembling troops,
marched towards the town. But the nobles were on the
alert. The Earl of Glencairn joined the congregation
with two thousand five hundred men; and a treaty was
concluded, by which both sides agreed to disarm, on
condition that no one should be punished for what had
already happened.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Such, however, was the state of
the public mind, that peace was impossible. In a few
days, war again broke out; and this time the result was
more decisive. The Lords of the Congregation mustered
in great force. Perth, Stirling, and Linlithgow,
fell into their hands. The queen-regent retreated before
them. She evacuated Edinburgh; and, on the 29th of
June, the Protestants entered the capital in triumph.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>All this was done in seven weeks from the breaking
out of the first riot. Both parties were now willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
negotiate, with the view of gaining time; the queen-regent
expecting aid from France, the Lords expecting
it from England.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> But the proceedings of Elizabeth
being tardy, the Protestants, after waiting for some
months, determined to strike a decisive blow before the
reinforcements arrived. In October, the principal peers,
headed by the Duke of Chastelherault, the Earl of
Arran, the Earl of Argyle, and the Earl of Glencairn,
assembled at Edinburgh. A great meeting was held,
of which Lord Ruthven was appointed president, and
in which the queen-regent was solemnly suspended from
the government, on the ground that she was opposed to
&lsquo;the glory of God, to the liberty of the realm, and to
the welfare of the nobles.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>In the winter, an English fleet sailed into the Frith,
and anchored near Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> In January 1560, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Duke of Norfolk arrived at Berwick, and concluded, on
the part of Elizabeth, a treaty with the Lords of the
Congregation, by virtue of which the English army entered
Scotland on the 2nd of April.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Against this
combination, the government could effect nothing, and
in July, was glad to sign a peace, by which the French
troops were to evacuate Scotland, and the whole power
of administration was virtually consigned to the Protestant
Lords.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>The complete success of this great revolution, and
the speed with which it was effected, are of themselves
a decisive proof of the energy of those general causes
by which the whole movement was controlled. For
more than a hundred and fifty years, there had been a
deadly struggle between the nobles and the Church:
and the issue of that struggle, was the establishment of
the Reformation, and the triumph of the aristocracy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
They had, at last, carried their point. The hierarchy
was overthrown, and replaced by new and untried men.
All the old notions of apostolic succession, of the imposition
of hands, and of the divine right of ordination,
were suddenly discarded. The offices of the Church
were performed by heretics, the majority of whom had
not even been ordained.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Finally, and to crown the
whole, in the summer of the same year, 1560, the Scotch
parliament passed two laws, which utterly subverted
the ancient scheme. By one of these laws, every
statute which had ever been enacted in favour of the
Church, was at once repealed.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> By the other law, it
was declared that whoever either said mass, or was
present while it was said, should, for the first offence,
lose his goods; for the second offence be exiled; and, for
the third offence, be put to death.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was, that an institution, which had borne the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
brunt of more than a thousand years, was shivered, and
fell to pieces. And, from its fall, great things were
augured. It was believed, that the people would be enlightened,
that their eyes were opening to their former
follies, and that the reign of superstition was about
to end. But what was forgotten then, and what is too
often forgotten now, is, that in these affairs there is an
order and a natural sequence, which can never be reversed.
This is, that every institution, as it actually
exists, no matter what its name or pretences may be, is
the effect of public opinion far more than the cause;
and that it will avail nothing to attack the institution,
unless you can first change the opinion. In Scotland,
the Church was grossly superstitious; but it did not,
therefore, follow, that to overthrow the establishment,
would lessen the evil. They who think that superstition
can be weakened in this way, do not know the vitality
of that dark and ill-omened principle. Against it, there
is only one weapon, and that weapon is knowledge.
When men are ignorant, they must be superstitious;
and wherever superstition exists, it is sure to organize
itself into some kind of system, which it makes its home.
If you drive it from that home, it will find another.
The spirit transmigrates; it assumes a new form; but
still it lives. How idle, then, is that warfare which
reformers are too apt to wage, in which they slay the
carcass, and spare the life! The husk, forsooth, they
seek out and destroy; but within that husk is a seed
of deadly poison, whose vitality they are unable to
impair, and which, shifted from its place, bears fruit
in another direction, and shoots up with a fresh, and
often a more fatal, exuberance.</p>

<p>The truth is, that every institution, whether political
or religious, represents, in its actual working, the form
and pressure of the age. It may be very old; it may
bear a venerated name; it may aim at the highest
objects: but whoever carefully studies its history, will
find that, in practice, it is successively modified by
successive generations, and that, instead of controlling
society, it is controlled by it. When the Protestant
Reformation was effected, the Scotch were excessively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ignorant, and, therefore, in spite of the Reformation,
they remained excessively superstitious. How long that
ignorance continued, and what its results were, we
shall presently see; but before entering into that inquiry,
it will be advisable to trace the immediate consequences
of the Reformation itself, in connexion with the powerful
class by whose authority it was established.</p>

<p>The nobles, having overthrown the Church, and
stripped it of a large part of its wealth, thought that
they were to reap the benefit of their own labour. They
had slain the enemy, and they wished to divide the
spoil.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> But this did not suit the views of the Protestant
preachers. In their opinion, it was impious to
secularize ecclesiastical property, and turn it aside to
profane purposes. They held, that it was right, indeed,
for the lords to plunder the Church; but they took for
granted that the proceeds of the robbery were to enrich
themselves. They were the godly men; and it was the
business of the ruling classes to endow them with benefices,
from which the old and idolatrous clergy were to
be expelled.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>In accordance with these opinions, Knox and his
colleagues, in August 1560, presented a petition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Parliament, calling on the nobles to restore the Church
property which they had seized, and to have it properly
applied to the support of the new ministers.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> To this
request, those powerful chiefs did not even vouchsafe
a reply.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> They were content with matters as they
actually stood, and were, therefore, unwilling to disturb
the existing arrangement. They had fought the fight;
they had gained the victory, and shared the spoil. It
was not to be supposed that they would peaceably relinquish
what they had won with infinite difficulty. Nor
was it likely that, after being engaged in an arduous
struggle with the Church for a hundred and fifty years,
and having at length conquered their inveterate enemy,
they should forego the fruits of their triumph for the
sake of a few preachers, whom they had but recently
called to their aid; low-born and obscure men, who
should rather deem it an honour that they were permitted
to associate with their superiors in a common
enterprise, but were not to presume on that circumstance,
nor to suppose that they, who only entered the
field at the eleventh hour, were to share the booty on
anything approaching to terms of equality.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>But the aristocracy of Scotland little knew the men
with whom they had to deal. Still less, did they understand
the character of their own age. They did not see
that, in the state of society in which they lived, superstition
was inevitable, and that, therefore, the spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
classes, though depressed for a moment, were sure
speedily to rise again. The nobles had overturned the
Church; but the principles on which Church authority
is based, remained intact. All that was done, was to
change the name and the form. A new hierarchy was
quickly organized, which succeeded the old one in the
affections of the people. Indeed, it did more. For, the
Protestant clergy, neglected by the nobles, and unendowed
by the state, had only a miserable pittance
whereupon to live, and they necessarily threw themselves
into the arms of the people, where alone they
could find support and sympathy.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Hence, a closer
and more intimate union than would otherwise have
been possible. Hence, too, as we shall presently see,
the Presbyterian clergy, smarting under the injustice
with which they were treated, displayed that hatred of
the upper classes, and that peculiar detestation of monarchical
government, which they showed whenever
they dared. In their pulpits, in their presbyteries, and in
their General Assemblies, they encouraged a democratic
and insubordinate tone, which eventually produced the
happiest results, by keeping alive, at a critical moment,
the spirit of liberty; but which, for that very reason,
made the higher ranks rue the day, when, by their ill-timed
and selfish parsimony, they roused the wrath of
so powerful and implacable a class.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the French troops, in 1560, had
left the nobles in possession of the government;<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and
it was for them to decide to what extent the Reformed
clergy should be endowed. The first petition, presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
by Knox and his brethren, was passed over in contemptuous
silence. But the ministers were not so
easily put aside. Their next step was, to present to the
Privy Council what is known as the First Book of
Discipline, in which they again urged their request.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
To the tenets contained in this book, the council had no
objection; but they refused to ratify it, because, by
doing so, they would have sanctioned the principle that
the new church had a right to the revenues of the old
one.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> A certain share, indeed, they were willing to
concede. What the share should be, was a matter of
serious dispute, and caused the greatest ill-will between
the two parties. At length, the nobles broke silence,
and, in December 1561, they declared that the Reformed
clergy should only receive one-sixth of the property of
the Church; the remaining five-sixths being divided
between the government and the Catholic priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
The meaning of this was easily understood, since the
Catholics were now entirely dependent on the government,
and the government was, in fact, the nobles
themselves, who were, at that period, the monopolizers
of political power.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it naturally happened, that,
when the arrangement was made known, the preachers
were greatly moved. They saw how unfavourable it
was to their own interests, and, therefore, they held
that it was unfavourable to the interests of religion.
Hence, in their opinion, it was contrived by the devil,
whose purposes it was calculated to serve.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> For, now,
they who travailed in the vineyard of the Lord, were to
be discouraged, and were to suffer, in order that what
rightly belonged to them might be devoured by idle
bellies.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The nobles might benefit for a time, but the
vengeance of God was swift, and would most assuredly
overtake them.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> From the beginning to the end, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
was nothing but spoliation. In a really Christian land,
the patrimony of the Church would be left untouched.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
But, in Scotland, alas! Satan had prevailed,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Christian charity had waxen cold.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> In Scotland,
property, which should be regarded as sacred, had
been broken up and divided; and the division was of
the worst kind, since, by it, said Knox, two-thirds are
given to the devil, and the other third is shared between
God and the devil. It was as if Joseph, when governor
of Egypt, had refused food to his brethren, and sent
them back to their families with empty sacks.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Or,
as another preacher suggested, the Church was now,
like the Maccabees of old, being oppressed, sometimes
by the Assyrians, and sometimes by the Egyptians.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>But neither persuasions nor threats<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> produced any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
effect on the obdurate minds of the Scotch nobles.
Indeed, their hearts, instead of being softened, became
harder. Even the small stipends, which were allotted
to the Protestant clergy, were not regularly paid, but
were mostly employed for other purposes.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> When the
ministers complained, they were laughed at, and insulted,
by the nobles, who, having gained their own ends,
thought that they could dispense with their former
allies.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The Earl of Morton, whose ability, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
connexions, made him the most powerful man in Scotland,
was especially virulent against them; and two of
the preachers, who offended him, he put to death, under
circumstances of great cruelty.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The nobles, regarding
him as their chief, elected him Regent in 1572;<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and,
being now possessed of supreme power, he employed it
against the Church. He seized upon all the benefices
which became vacant, and retained their profits in his
own hands.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> His hatred of the preachers passed all
bounds. He publicly declared, that there would be
neither peace nor order in the country, until some of
them were hung.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> He refused to sanction the General
Assemblies by his presence; he wished to do away with
their privileges, and even with their name; and with
such determination did he pursue his measures, that,
in the opinion of the historian of the Scotch Kirk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
nothing but the special interference of the Deity could
have maintained its existing polity.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>The rupture between Church and State was now complete.
It remained to be seen, which was the stronger
side. Every year, the clergy became more democratic;
and, after the death of Knox, in 1572, they ventured
upon a course which even he would hardly have recommended,
and which, during the earlier period of the
Reformation, would have been impracticable.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> But,
by this time, they had secured the support of the
people; and the treatment they were receiving from the
government, and from the nobles, embittered their
minds, and drove them into desperate counsels. While
their plans were yet immature, and while the future was
looming darkly before them, a new man arose, who was
well qualified to be their chief, and who at once stepped
into the place which the death of Knox left vacant.
This was Andrew Melville, who, by his great ability,
his boldness of character, and his fertility of resource,
was admirably suited to be the leader of the Scottish
Church in that arduous struggle in which it was about
to embark.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1574, Melville, having completed his education
abroad, arrived in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> He quickly rallied round
him the choicest spirits in the Church; and, under his
auspices, a struggle began with the civil power, which
continued, with many fluctuations, until it culminated,
sixty years later, in open rebellion against Charles I.
To narrate all the details of the contest, would be inconsistent
with the plan of this Introduction; and, notwithstanding
the extreme interest of the events which
now ensued, the greater part of them must be omitted;
but I will endeavour to indicate the general march, and
to put the reader in possession of such facts as are most
characteristic of the age in which they occurred.</p>

<p>Melville had not been in Scotland many months, before
he began his opposition, at first by secret intrigues,
afterwards with open and avowed hostility.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In the
time of Knox, episcopacy had been recognized as part
of the Protestant Church, and had received the sanction
of the leading Reformers.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> But that institution did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
not harmonize with the democratic spirit which was
now growing up. The difference of ranks between
the bishops and the inferior clergy was unpleasant, and
the ministers determined to put an end to it.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> In
1575, one of them, named John Dury, was instigated,
by Melville, to bring the subject before the General
Assembly at Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> After he had spoken, Melville
also expressed himself against episcopacy; but,
not being yet sure of the temper of the audience, his
first proceedings were somewhat cautious. Such hesitation
was, however, hardly necessary; for, owing to
the schism between the Church and the upper classes,
the ministers were becoming the eager enemies of those
maxims of obedience, and of subordination, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
would have upheld, had the higher ranks been on their
side. As it was, the clergy were only favoured by the
people; they, therefore, sought to organize a system
of equality, and were ripe for the bold measures proposed
by Melville and his followers. This was clearly
shown, by the rapidity of the subsequent movement.
In 1575, the first attack was made in the General Assembly
at Edinburgh. In April 1578, another General
Assembly resolved, that, for the future, bishops should
be called by their own names, and not by their titles.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
The same body also declared, that no see should be filled
up, until the next Assembly.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Two months afterwards,
it was announced that this arrangement was to be perpetual,
and that no new bishop should ever be made.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
And, in 1580, the Assembly of the Church at Dundee,
pulling the whole fabric to the ground, unanimously
resolved that the office of bishop was a mere human
invention; that it was unlawful; that it must be immediately
done away with; and that every bishop should
at once resign his office, or be excommunicated if he
refuse to do so.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The minister and the people had now done their
work, and, so far as they were concerned, had done it
well.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But the same circumstances which made them
desire equality, made the upper classes desire inequality.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
A collision, therefore, was inevitable, and
was hastened by this bold proceeding of the Church.
Indeed, the preachers, supported by the people, rather
courted a contest, than avoided it. They used the most
inflammatory language against episcopacy; and, shortly
before abolishing it, they completed, and presented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Parliament, the Second Book of Discipline, in which
they flatly contradicted what they had asserted in their
First Book of Discipline.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> For this, they are often
taunted with inconsistency.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> But the charge is unjust.
They were perfectly consistent; and they merely
changed their maxims, that they might preserve their
principles. Like every corporation, which has ever
existed, whether spiritual or temporal, their supreme
and paramount principle was to maintain their own
power. Whether or not this is a good principle, is
another matter; but all history proves that it is an
universal one. And when the leaders of the Scotch
Church found that it was at stake, and that the question
at issue was, who should possess authority, they, with
perfect consistency, abandoned opinions that they had
formerly held, because they now perceived that those
opinions were unfavourable to their existence as an
independent body.</p>

<p>When the First Book of Discipline appeared, in 1560,
the government was in the hands of the nobles, who
had just fought on the side of the Protestant preachers,
and were ready to fight again on their side. When
the Second Book of Discipline appeared, in 1578, the
government was still held by the nobles; but those
ambitious men had now thrown off the mask, and,
having effected their purpose in destroying the old
hierarchy, had actually turned round, and attacked
the new one. The circumstances having changed, the
Church changed with them; but in the change there
was nothing inconsistent. On the contrary, it would
have been the height of inconsistency for the ministers
to have retained their former notions of obedience and
of subordination; and it was perfectly natural that, at
this crisis, they should advocate the democratic idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
equality, just as before they had advanced the aristocratic
idea of inequality.</p>

<p>Hence it was, that, in their First Book of Discipline,
they established a regularly ascending hierarchy, according
to which the general clergy owed obedience to their
ecclesiastical superiors, to whom the name of superintendents
was given.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> But, in the Second Book of Discipline,
every vestige of this was swept away; and it was
laid down in the broadest terms, that all the preachers
being fellow-labourers, all were equal in power; that
none had authority over others; and that, to claim such
authority, or to assert preëminence, was a contrivance
of man, not to be permitted in a divinely constituted
Church.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The government, as may be supposed, took a very
different view. Such doctrines were deemed, by the
upper classes, to be anti-social, and to be subversive of
all order.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> So far from sanctioning them, they resolved,
if possible, to overthrow them; and, the year
after the General Assembly had abolished episcopacy,
it was determined that, upon that very point, a trial of
strength should be made between the two parties.</p>

<p>In 1581, Robert Montgomery was appointed archbishop
of Glasgow. The ministers who composed the
chapter of Glasgow refused to elect him; whereupon
the Privy Council declared that the King, by virtue of
his prerogative, had the right of nomination.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> All
was now confusion and uproar. The General Assembly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
forbad the archbishop to enter Glasgow.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> He refused to
obey their order, and threw himself upon the support of
the Duke of Lennox, who had obtained the appointment
for him, and to whom he, in return, had surrendered
nearly all the revenues of the see, reserving for himself
only a small stipend.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> This was a custom which had
grown up within the last few years, and was one of
many contrivances by which the nobles plundered the
Church of her property.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>This, however, was not the question now at issue.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
The point to be decided was one, not of revenue, but of
power. For the clergy knew full well, that if they established
their power, the revenue would quickly follow.
They, therefore, adopted the most energetic proceedings.
In April 1582, the General Assembly met at St. Andrews,
and appointed Melville as Moderator.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The government,
fearing the worst, ordered the members, on pain
of rebellion, to take no steps respecting the archbishopric.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
But the representatives of the Church were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
undaunted. They summoned Montgomery before them;
they ratified the sentence by which he had been suspended
from the ministry; and they declared that he
had incurred the penalties of despotism and of excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>A sentence of excommunication was, in those days,
so ruinous, that Montgomery was struck with terror at
the prospect before him. To avoid the consequences,
he appeared before the Assembly, and solemnly promised
that he would make no further attempt to possess himself
of the archbishopric.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> By doing this, he probably
saved his life; for the people, siding with their clergy,
were ripe for mischief, and were determined, at all
hazards, to maintain what they considered to be the
rights of the Church, in opposition to the encroachments
of the State.</p>

<p>The government, on the other hand, was equally
resolute.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The Privy Council called several of the
ministers before them; and Dury, one of the most active,
they banished from Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Measures still
more violent were about to be taken, when they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
interrupted by one of those singular events which not
unfrequently occurred in Scotland, and which strikingly
evince the inherent weakness of the Crown, notwithstanding
the inordinate pretensions it commonly
assumed.</p>

<p>This was the Raid of Ruthven, which happened in
1582, and in consequence of which the person of James
VI. was held in durance for ten months.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The
clergy, true to the policy which now governed them,
loudly approved of the captivity of the king, and pronounced
it to be a godly act.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Dury, who had been
driven from his pulpit, was brought back to the capital
in triumph;<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and the General Assembly, meeting at
Edinburgh, ordered that the imprisonment of James
should be justified by every minister to his own congregation.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1583, the king recovered his liberty, and the
struggle became more deadly than ever; the passions of
both parties being exasperated by the injuries each had
inflicted on the other. The Ruthven conspiracy, having
been declared treason, as it undoubtedly was, Dury
preached in its favour, and openly defended it; and
although, under the influence of momentary fear, he
afterwards withdrew what he had said,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> it was evident,
from other circumstances, that his feelings were
shared by his brethren.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> A number of them being
summoned before the king for their seditious language,
bad him take heed what he was about, and reminded
him that no occupant of the throne had ever prospered
after the ministers had begun to threaten him.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
Melville, who exercised immense influence over both
clergy and people, bearded the king to his face, refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to account for what he had delivered in the pulpit, and
told James that he perverted the laws both of God and
of man.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Simpson likened him to Cain, and warned
him to beware of the wrath of God.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Indeed, the
spirit now displayed by the Church was so implacable,
that it seemed to delight in venting itself in the most
repulsive manner. In 1585, a clergyman, named Gibson,
in a sermon which he preached in Edinburgh, denounced
against the king the curse of Jeroboam, that he should
die childless, and that his race should end with him.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
The year after this happened, James, finding that
Elizabeth was evidently determined to take his mother's
life, bethought him of what was valued in that age as
an unfailing resource, and desired the clergy to offer up
prayers on behalf of Mary. This, they almost unanimously
refused.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> And not only did they abstain from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
supplication themselves, but they resolved that no one
else should do what they had declined. The archbishop
of Saint Andrews being about to officiate before the
king, they induced a certain John Cowper to station
himself in the pulpit beforehand, so as to exclude the
prelate. Nor was it until the captain of the guard
threatened to pull Cowper from the place he had
usurped, that the service could go on, and the king be
allowed to hear his own mother prayed for, in this sad
crisis of her fate, when it was still uncertain whether
she would be publicly executed, or whether, as was more
generally believed, she would be secretly poisoned.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1594, John Ross stated in the pulpit, that the
advisers of the king were all traitors, and that the king
himself was likewise a traitor. He was also a rebel and
a reprobate. That such should be the case, was not
surprising, considering the parentage of James. For,
his mother was a Guise, and a persecutor of the saints.
He avoided open persecution, and spoke them fair; but
his deeds did not correspond to his words; and, so great
was his dissimulation, that he was the most arrant
hypocrite then living in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>In 1596, David Black, one of the most influential of
the Protestant ministers, delivered a sermon, which
made much noise. He said, in his discourse, that all
kings were children of the devil; but that in Scotland
the head of the court was Satan himself. The members
of the council, he added, were cormorants, and the
lords of the session miscreants. The nobility had
degenerated: they were godless; they were dissemblers;
they were the enemies of the Church. As
to the queen of England, she was nothing but an
atheist. And as to the queen of Scotland, all he would
say was, that they might pray for her if they list, and
because it was the fashion to do so; but that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
no reason for it, inasmuch as no good would ever come
from her to them.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>For preaching this sermon, Black was summoned by
the privy-council. He refused to attend, because it
was for a spiritual tribunal, and not for a temporal one,
to take notice of what was uttered in the pulpit. The
Church, to be sure, he would obey; but, having received
his message from God, he was bound to deliver it, and
it would be a dereliction of duty, if he were to allow
the civil power to judge such matters.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
greatly enraged, ordered Black to be cast into prison;
and it is difficult to see what other course was open to
him; though it was certain that neither this, nor any
measure he could adopt, would tame the indomitable
spirit of the Scotch Church.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>In December the same year, the Church proclaimed a
fast; and Welsh preached in Edinburgh a sermon, with
the view of rousing the people against their rulers. The
king, he told his audience, had formerly been possessed
by a devil, and that devil being put out, seven worse ones
had come in its place. It was, therefore, evident that
James was demented, and it became lawful to take the
sword of justice from his hands; just as it would be
lawful for servants or children to seize the head of their
family, if it had pleased heaven to afflict him with madness.
In such case, the preacher observed, it would be
right to lay hold of the madman, and to tie him hand
and foot, that he might do no further harm.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>The hatred felt by the clergy was at this period so
bitter, and the democratic spirit in them so strong,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that they seemed unable to restrain themselves; and
Andrew Melville, in an audience with the king, in 1596,
proceeded to personal insults, and, seizing him by the
sleeve, called him God's silly vassal.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The large
amount of truth contained in this bitter taunt, increased
its pungency. But the ministers did not always confine
themselves to words.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Their participation in the
Ruthven conspiracy is unquestionable; and it is probable
that they were privy to the last great peril to which
James was exposed, before he escaped from that turbulent
land, which he was believed to govern. Certain it
is, that the Earl of Gowrie, who, in 1600, entrapped the
king into his castle in order to murder him, was the
hope and the mainstay of the Presbyterian clergy, and
was intimately associated with their ambitious schemes.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
Such, indeed, was their infatuation on behalf of the
assassin, that, when his conspiracy was defeated, and
he himself slain, several of the ministers propagated a
report that Gowrie had fallen a victim to the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
perfidy, and that, in point of fact, the only plot which
ever existed was one concocted by the king, with fatal
art, against his mild and innocent host.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>An absurdity of this sort<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> was easily believed in an
ignorant, and, therefore, a credulous, age. That the
clergy should have propagated it, and that in this, as in
many other cases, they should have laboured with malignant
industry to defame the character of their prince,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
will astonish no one who knows how quickly the wrath
of the Church can be roused, and how ready the spiritual
classes always are to cover, even with the foulest
calumny, those who stand in their way. The evidence
which has been collected, proves that the Presbyterian
ministers carried their violence against the constituted
authorities of the state, to an indecent, if not to a
criminal, length; and we cannot absolve them from the
charge of being a restless and unscrupulous body, greedy
after power, and grossly intolerant of whatever opposed
their own views. Still, the real cause of their conduct
was, the spirit of their age, and the peculiarities of their
position. None of us can be sure that, if we were
placed exactly as they were placed, we should have acted
differently. Now, indeed, we cannot read of their proceedings,
as they are recorded in their own Assemblies,
and by the historians of their own Church, without an
uneasy feeling of dislike, I had almost said of disgust, at
finding ourselves in presence of so much of superstition,
of chicanery, of low, sordid arts, and yet, withal, of
arrogant and unbridled insolence. The truth, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
is, that in Scotland, the age was evil, and the evil rose
to the surface. The times were out of joint, and it was
hard to set them right. The long prevalence of anarchy,
of ignorance, of poverty, of force, of fraud, of domestic
tumult, and of foreign invasion, had reduced Scotland
to a state which is scarcely possible for us to realize.
Hereafter, I shall give some evidence of the effect which
this produced on the national character, and of the
serious mischief which it wrought. In the mean time,
we should, in fairness to the Scotch clergy, admit that
the condition of their country affords the best explanation
of their conduct. Everything around them was
low and coarse; the habits of men, in their daily life,
were violent, brutal, and utterly regardless of common
decency; and, as a natural consequence, the standard
of human actions was so depressed, that upright and
well-meaning persons did not shrink from doing what
to us, in our advanced state of society, seems incredible.
Let us, then, not be too rash in this matter. Let us not
be too forward in censuring the leading actors in that
great crisis through which Scotland passed, during the
latter half of the sixteenth century. Much they did,
which excites our strongest aversion. But one thing
they achieved, which should make us honour their memory,
and repute them benefactors of their species. At
a most hazardous moment, they kept alive the spirit of
national liberty.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> What the nobles and the crown had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
put in peril, that did the clergy save. By their care,
the dying spark was kindled into a blaze. When the
light grew dim, and flickered on the altar, their hands
trimmed the lamp, and fed the sacred flame. This is
their real glory, and on this they may well repose. They
were the guardians of Scotch freedom, and they stood
to their post. Where danger was, they were foremost.
By their sermons, by their conduct, both public and
private, by the proceedings of their Assemblies, by their
bold and frequent attacks upon persons, without regard
to their rank, nay, even by the very insolence with
which they treated their superiors, they stirred up the
minds of men, woke them from their lethargy, formed
them to habits of discussion, and excited that inquisitive
and democratic spirit, which is the only effectual guarantee
the people can ever possess against the tyranny
of those who are set over them. This was the work of
the Scotch clergy; and all hail to them who did it. It
was they who taught their countrymen to scrutinize,
with a fearless eye, the policy of their rulers. It was
they who pointed the finger of scorn at kings and nobles,
and laid bare the hollowness of their pretensions. They
ridiculed their claims, and jeered at their mysteries.
They tore the veil, and exposed the tricks of the scene
which lay behind. The great ones of the earth, they
covered with contempt; and those who were above them,
they cast down. Herein, they did a deed which should
compensate for all their offences, even were their offences
ten times as great. By discountenancing that pernicious
and degrading respect which men are too apt to pay to
those whom accident, and not merit, has raised above
them, they facilitated the growth of a proud and sturdy
independence, which was sure to do good service at a
time of need. And that time came quicker than any one
had expected. Within a very few years, James became
master of the resources of England, and attempted, by
their aid, to subvert the liberties of Scotland. The
shameful enterprise, which he began, was continued by
his cruel and superstitious son. How their attempts
failed; how Charles I., in the effort, shipwrecked his
fortune, and provoked a rebellion, which brought to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
scaffold that great criminal, who dared to conspire
against the people, and who, as the common enemy and
oppressor of all, was at length visited with the just
punishment of his sins, is known to every reader of our
history. It is also well known, that, in conducting the
struggle, the English were greatly indebted to the
Scotch, who had, moreover, the merit of being the first
to lift their hand against the tyrant. What, however,
is less known, but is undoubtedly true, is, that both
nations owe a debt they can never repay to those bold
men who, during the latter part of the sixteenth century,
disseminated, from their pulpits and Assemblies,
sentiments which the people cherished in their hearts,
and which, at a fitting moment, they reproduced, to the
dismay, and eventually to the destruction, of those who
threatened their liberties.</p>

George of his Privy Council.&rsquo; <i>Hume's History of the House of Douglas</i>,
vol. ii. pp. 105, 106. James was very jealous of any communication
taking place between the Douglases and his other subjects; but it was
impossible for him to prevent it. See a letter which he wrote to Sir
Thomas Erskine (in <i>Miscellany of the Spalding Club</i>, vol. ii. p. 193,
Aberdeen, 1842, 4to), beginning, &lsquo;I commend me rycht hartly to yow, and

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_147_147" id="Footnote_147_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> &lsquo;The Douglases were still maintained with high favour and
generous allowances in England; their power, although nominally extinct,
was still far from being destroyed; their spies penetrated into every
quarter, followed the king to France, and gave information of his most
private motions; their feudal covenants and bands of manrent still
existed, and bound many of the most potent nobility to their interest;
whilst the vigour of the king's government, and his preference of the
clergy to the temporal lords, disgusted these proud chiefs, and disposed
them to hope for a recovery of their influence from any change which
might take place.&rsquo; <i>Tytler's History of Scotland</i>, vol. iv. pp. 229,
230. These bonds of manrent, noticed by Tytler, were among the most
effective means by which the Scotch nobles secured their power. Without
them, it would have been difficult for the aristocracy to have resisted
the united force of the Crown and the Church. On this account, they
deserve special attention. Chalmers (<i>Caledonia</i>, vol. i. p. 824) could
find no bond of manrent earlier than 1354; but in Lord Somerville's
<i>Memorie of the Somervilles</i>, edit. Edinburgh, 1815, vol. i. p. 74, one
is mentioned in 1281. This is the earliest instance I have met with; and
they did not become very common till the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. Compare <i>Hume's History of the House of Douglas</i>, vol. ii. p.
19. <i>Somerville's Memorie of the Somervilles</i>, vol. i. p. 234.
<i>Pitcairn's Criminal Trials in Scotland</i>, vol. iii. p. 83. <i>Irving's
History of Dumbartonshire</i>, pp. 142, 143. <i>Skene's Highlanders</i>, vol.
ii. p. 186. <i>Gregory's History of the Western Highlands</i>, p. 126.
<i>Kennedy's Annals of Aberdeen</i>, vol. i. p. 55. <i>Miscellany of the
Spalding Club</i>, vol. ii. pp. cvi. 93, 251, vol. iv. pp. xlviii. 179. As
these covenants were extremely useful in maintaining the balance of
power, and preventing the Scotch monarchy from becoming despotic, acts
of parliament were of course passed against them. See one in 1457, and
another in 1555, respecting &lsquo;lige&rsquo; and &lsquo;bandis of manrent and
mantenance,&rsquo; in <i>Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland</i>, folio, 1814, vol.
ii. pp. 50, 495. Such enactments being opposed to the spirit of the age,
and adverse to the exigencies of society, produced no effect upon the
general practice, though they caused the punishment of several
individuals. Manrent was still frequent until about 1620 or 1630, when
the great social revolution was completed, by which the power of the
aristocracy was subordinated to that of the Church. Then, the change of
affairs effected, without difficulty, and indeed spontaneously, what the
legislature had vainly attempted to achieve. The nobles, gradually
sinking into insignificance, lost their spirit, and ceased to resort to
those contrivances by which they had long upheld their order. Bonds of
manrent became every year less common, and it is doubtful if there is
any instance of them after 1661. See <i>Chalmers' Caledonia</i>, vol. iii.
pp. 32, 33. It is, however, so dangerous to assert a negative, that I do
not wish to rely on this date, and some few cases may exist later; but
if so, they are very few, and it is certain that, speaking generally,
the middle of the seventeenth century is the epoch of their extinction.</p></div>

such an assertion I cannot find the slightest evidence, except the
declaration of Arran (<i>Sadler's State Papers</i>, Edinburgh, 1809, vol. i.
p. 138), and the testimony, if testimony it can be called, of Scotch
historians, who do not profess to have examined the handwriting, and
who, being themselves Protestants, seem to suppose that the fact of a
man being a cardinal, qualifies him for every crime. There is no doubt
that Beaton was thoroughly unprincipled, and therefore was capable of
the forgery. Still, we have no proof; and the will is such as we might
have expected from the king. In regard to Arran, his affirmation is not
worth the paper it is written on: for he hated Beaton; he was himself
very unscrupulous; and he succeeded to the post which Beaton had to
vacate on the ground that the will was forged. If such circumstances do
not disqualify a witness, some of the best-established principles of
evidence are false. The reader who cares to look further into this
subject, may compare, in favour of the will being forged, <i>Buchanan</i>,

the subject leave it doubtful: <i>Tytler's History of Scotland</i>, 1845,

regent and Douglas, which, as I do not remember to have met with
elsewhere, I shall transcribe. The exact date of it is not mentioned,
but, from the context, it evidently took place in 1544 or 1545. &lsquo;Ibi cum
Prorex suam deploraret solitudinem, et se a nobilitate derelictum
quereretur, Duglassius ostendit &ldquo;id ipsius culpa fieri, non nobilium,
qui et fortunas omnes et vitam ad publicam salutem tuendam conferrent,
quorum consilio contempto ad sacrificulorum nutum circumageretur, qui
foris imbelles, domi seditiosi, omniumque periculorum expertes alieni
laboris fructu ad suas voluptates abuterentur. Ex hoc fonte inter te et
proceres facta est suspitio, quæ (quòd neutri alteris fidatis) rebus
gerendis maxime est impedimento.&rdquo;&rsquo; <i>Rerum Scoticarum Historia</i>, lib. xv.
p. 435. Buchanan was, at this time, about thirty-eight years old; and
that some such conversation as that which he narrates actually took
place, is, I think, highly probable, though the historian may have
thrown in some touches of his own. At all events, he was too great a
rhetorician to invent what his contemporaries would deem unlikely to
happen; so that, from either point of view, the passage is valuable as
an evidence of the deep-rooted hostility which the nobles bore towards
the Church.</p></div>

is entirely unknown either to our Scottish or English historians; and
now, after the lapse of nearly three centuries, has been discovered in
the secret correspondence of the State-paper Office.&rsquo; The first
suggestion of the murder was in April 1544. See <i>State Papers of Henry
VIII.</i>, vol. v. p. 377, and the end of the Preface to vol. iv. But Mr.
Tytler and the editor of the <i>State Papers</i> appear to have overlooked a
still earlier indication of the coming crime, in <i>Sadler's Papers</i>. See,
in that collection, vol. i. p. 77, a conversation, held in March 1543,
between Sir Ralph Sadler and the Earl of Arran; Sadler being conducted
by the Earl of Glencairn. On that occasion, the Earl of Arran used an
expression concerning Beaton, the meaning of which Sir Ralph evidently
understood. &lsquo;&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;he shall never come out of prison
whilst I may have mine own will, <i>except it be to his farther
mischief</i>.&rdquo; I allowed the same well&rsquo; (replied Sadler), &lsquo;and said, &ldquo;It
were pity, but he should receive such reward as his merits did
require.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p></div>

life of Knox should have yet been published. That by M'Crie is an
undistinguishing and injudicious panegyric, which, by provoking a
reaction of opinion, has damaged the reputation of the great reformer.
On the other hand, the sect of Episcopalians in Scotland are utterly
blind to the real grandeur of the man, and unable to discern his intense
love of truth, and the noble fearlessness of his nature.</p></div>

contrived with considerable art, was, that one-third of the church
revenues should be divided into two parts; one part for the government,
and another part for the preachers. The remaining two-thirds were
gravely assigned to the Catholic priesthood, who, at that very moment,
were liable, by Act of Parliament, to the penalty of death, if they
performed the rites of their religion. Men, whose lives were in the

deeply the members of his profession felt this spoliation of the Church,
by going out of his way to mention it. See <i>Jacob's Vow, by Dr. John
Cockburn</i>, Edinburgh, 1696, pp. 422, 423, 425. But this is nothing in
comparison to a recent writer, the Reverend Mr. Lyon, who deliberately
asserts that, because these and similar acts occurred in the reign of
Mary, therefore the queen came to a violent end; such being the just
punishment of sacrilege. &lsquo;The practice&rsquo; (of saying masses for the dead)
&lsquo;ceased, of course, at the Reformation; and the money was transferred by
Queen Mary to the civil authorities of the town. This was, undoubtedly,
an act of sacrilege; for, though sacrificial masses for the dead was an
error, yet the guardians of the money so bequeathed, were under an
obligation to apply it to a sacred purpose. This, and other sacrilegious
acts on the part of Mary, of a still more decided and extensive
character, have been justly considered as the cause of all the
calamities which subsequently befell her.&rsquo; <i>History of St. Andrews, by
the Rev. C. J. Lyon, M.A., Presbyter of the Episcopal Church, St.
Andrews</i>, Edinburgh, 1843, vol. i. p. 54. Elsewhere (vol. ii. p. 400)
the same divine mentions, that the usual punishment for sacrilege is a
failure of male issue. &lsquo;The following examples, selected from the
diocese of St. Andrews, according to its boundaries before the
Reformation, will corroborate the general doctrine contended for
throughout this work, that sacrilege has ever been punished in the
present life, and <i>chiefly</i> by the failure of male issue.&rsquo; The italics
are in the text. See also vol. i. p. 118. For the sake of the future
historian of public opinion, it may be well to observe, that the work
containing these sentiments is not a reprint of an older book, but was
published for the first time in 1843, having apparently been just
written.</p></div>

possibility of excommunicating those who would not surrender to the
Protestant preachers, the property stolen from the Catholic Church; and,
in 1570, we find another step taken in the same direction. Under that
year, the following passage occurs in <i>Acts and Proceedings of the
General Assemblies of the Kirk of Scotland</i>, vol. i. p. 181. &lsquo;Q. If
those that withold the duty of the Kirk, <i>wherethrough Ministers want

First Book, in 1560) &lsquo;were distinguished by prelatical principles to the
end of their days.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;That Knox himself was no enemy to prelacy,
considered as an ancient and apostolical institution, is rendered clear
by his &ldquo;Exhortation to England for the speedy embracing of Christ's
Gospel.&rdquo;&rsquo; <i>Russell's History of the Church in Scotland</i>, 1834, vol. i.
p. 240. &lsquo;The associates of Knox, it is obvious, were not Presbyterians,
and had no intention of setting up a system of parity among the
ministers of their new establishment.&rsquo; p. 243. See also p. 332. Even in
1572, the year of Knox's death, I find it stated that &lsquo;the whole Diocie
of Sanct Andrews is decerned be the Assembly to pertain to the Bishop of
the same.&rsquo; <i>Acts and Proceedings of the General Assemblies of the Kirk
of Scotland</i>, vol. i. p. 264, 4to. 1839. The Scotch Presbyterians have

Edinburgh, in an Assembly which was then convened, to propound a
question touching the lawfulness of the episcopal function, and the
authority of chapters in their election. He himself, as though he had
not been acquainted with the motion, after he had commended the
speaker's zeal, and seconded the purpose with a long discourse of the
flourishing estate of the church of Geneva, and the opinions of Calvin
and Theodore Beza concerning church government, came to affirm, &ldquo;That
none ought to be esteemed office-bearers in the Church whose titles were
not found in the book of God. And, for the title of bishops, albeit the
same was found in Scripture, yet was it not to be taken in the sense
that the common sort did conceive, there being no superiority allowed by
Christ amongst ministers,&rdquo;&rsquo; &amp;c. <i>Spottiswoode's History of the Church of
Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 200. See also <i>Acts of the General Assemblies</i>,
vol. i. p. 331, where it appears that six bishops were present on this
memorable occasion. The question raised was, &lsquo;Whither if the Bischops,
as they are now in the Kirk of Scotland, hes thair function of the word
of God or not, or if the Chapiter appointit for creating of them aucht
to be tollerated in this reformed Kirk.&rsquo; p. 340.</p></div>

that, while &lsquo;the great body of the burghers, and middle and lower
classes of the people,&rsquo; were Presbyterians, &lsquo;a large proportion of the
nobility supported episcopacy.&rsquo; Instead of &lsquo;a large proportion,&rsquo; he
would not have been far wrong, if he had said &lsquo;all.&rsquo; Indeed, &lsquo;Melville
himself says the whole peerage was against him.&rsquo; <i>Stephen's History of
the Church of Scotland</i>, vol. i. p. 269. Forbes ascribes the
aristocratic movement against presbytery to &lsquo;godles atheists,&rsquo; who
insisted &lsquo;that there could be nothing so contrair to the nature of a
monarchie,&rsquo; &amp;c., &lsquo;than that paritie of authoritie in pastours.&rsquo;
<i>Forbes</i>, <i>Certaine Records touching the Estate of the Kirk</i>, p. 349,
edit. Wodrow Society. See also p. 355. &lsquo;That Democratie (as they called
it) whilk allwayes behoved to be full of sedition and troubble to ane
Aristocratie, and so in end to a Monarchie.&rsquo; The reader will observe
this important change in the attitude of classes in Scotland. Formerly,
the clergy had been the allies of the crown against the nobles. Now, the
nobles allied themselves with the crown against the clergy. The clergy,
in self-defence, had to ally themselves with the people.</p></div>

some remarks worth looking at, in <i>Argyll's Presbytery Examined</i>, 1848,

Presbyterian authors, is unwilling to admit how completely the Second
Book of Discipline contradicts the First.</p></div>

first volume of <i>A Compendium of the Laws of the Church of Scotland</i>, 2d
edit., Edinburgh, 1837. The superintendents were &lsquo;to set, order, and
appoint ministers,&rsquo; p. 61; and it would seem (p. 88) that no minister
could be deposed without the consent of his superintendent; but this
could hardly be intended to interfere with the supreme authority of the
General Assembly. See also the summary, p. 114, where it is said of the
superintendents, that &lsquo;in thair visitatioun thei sal not onlie preiche,
but als examine the doctrine, life, diligence, and behavior of the
ministeris, reideris, elderis, and deaconis.&rsquo; According to Spottiswoode
(<i>History of the Church of Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 167), &lsquo;the
superintendents held their office during life, and their power was
episcopal; for they did elect and ordain ministers, they presided in
synods, and directed all church censures, neither was any
excommunication pronounced without their warrant.&rsquo; See further, on their
authority, <i>Knox's History of the Reformation</i>, vol. ii. p. 161. &lsquo;That
punyschment suld be appointed for suche as dissobeyid or contemned the
superintendentes in thair functioun.&rsquo; This was in 1561; and, in 1562,
&lsquo;It was ordained, that if ministers be disobedient to superintendents in
anything belonging to edification, they must be subject to correction.&rsquo;
<i>Acts of the General Assemblies of the Kirk</i>, vol. i. p. 14. Compare p.
131: &lsquo;sick things as superintendents may and aught decyde in their
synodall conventiouns.&rsquo;</p></div>

Jesus Christ, who is the onlie King, hie Priest, and Heid thereof, yit
he useis the ministry of men, as the most necessar middis for this
purpose.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;And to take away all occasion of tyrannie, he willis that
they sould rewl with mutuall consent of brether and <i>equality of power</i>,
every one according to thair functiones.&rsquo; <i>Second Book of Discipline</i>,
in <i>A Compendium of the Laws of the Church of Scotland</i>, vol. i. pp.
126, 127. &lsquo;As to Bischops, if the name &#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#962; be properly
taken, <i>they ar all ane with the ministers</i>, as befoir was declairit.
For it is <i>not a name of superioritie and lordschip</i>, bot of office and
watching.&rsquo; p. 142. To understand the full meaning of this, it should be
mentioned, that the superintendents, established by the Kirk in 1560,
not unfrequently assumed the title of &lsquo;Lordship,&rsquo; as an ornament to the
extensive powers conferred upon them. See, for instance, the notes to
<i>Wodrow's Collections upon the Lives of the Reformers of the Church of
Scotland</i>, vol. i. part ii. p. 461. But, in the Second Book of
Discipline, in 1578, the superintendents are, if I rightly remember, not
even once named.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_237_237" id="Footnote_237_237"></a><a href="#FNanchor_237_237"><span class="label">[237]</span></a> Just as in England, we find that the upper classes are
mostly Episcopalians; their minds being influenced, often unconsciously,
by the, to them, pleasing spectacle of an inequality of rank, which is
conventional, and does not depend upon ability. On the other hand, the
strength of the Dissenters lies among the middle and lower classes,
where energy and intellect are held in higher respect, and where a
contempt naturally arises for a system, which, at the mere will of the
sovereign or minister of the day, concedes titles and wealth to persons
whom nature did not intend for greatness, but who, to the surprise of
their contemporaries, have greatness thrust upon them. On this
difference of opinion in Scotland, corresponding to the difference of
social position, see the remarks on the seventeenth century, in <i>Hume's
Commentaries on the Law of Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 544, Edinburgh, 1797,

required only its assent. Discussion and freedom of speech were unknown
in its meetings. The courts of justice were dependent on the will of the
sovereign, and frequently had their proceedings regulated, and their
decisions dictated, by letters or messages from the throne. It was the
preachers who first taught the people to express an opinion on the

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">CONDITION OF SCOTLAND DURING THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES.</div>

<p>Scarcely had James mounted the throne of England,
when he began seriously, and on a large scale, to attempt
to subjugate the Scotch Church, which, as he clearly
saw, was the principal obstacle that stood between him
and despotic power. While he was merely King of
Scotland, he made several efforts, which were constantly
baffled; but now that he wielded the vast resources of
England, the victory seemed easy.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> As early as 1584,
he had gained a temporary triumph, by forcing many of
the clergy to recognize episcopacy.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> But that institution
was so repugnant to their levelling and democratic
principles, that nothing could overcome their abhorrence
of it;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and, completely overawing the king, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
compelled him to give way, and to retrace his steps. The
result was, that, in 1592, an Act of Parliament was
passed, which subverted the authority of the bishops,
and established Presbyterianism; a scheme based on
the idea of equality, and, therefore, suited to the wants
of the Scotch Church.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>To this statute, James had assented with the greatest
reluctance.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Indeed, his feeling respecting it was so
strong, that he determined, on the first opportunity, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
procure its repeal, even if he used force to effect his
purpose. The course he adopted, was characteristic
both of the man and of the age. In December 1596,
one of those popular tumults arose in Edinburgh, which
are natural in barbarous times, and which, under ordinary
circumstances, would have been quelled, and
nothing more thought of it.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> But James availed himself
of this, to strike what he deemed a decisive blow.
His plan was nothing less than to turn into the capital
of his own monarchy, large bodies of armed and licensed
banditti, who, by threatening to plunder the city, should
oblige the clergy and their flocks to agree to whatever
terms he chose to dictate. This magnanimous scheme
was well worthy of the mind of James, and it was strictly
executed. From the north, he summoned the Highland
nobles, and from the south, the border barons, who were
to be accompanied by their fierce retainers,&mdash;men who
lived by pillage, and whose delight it was to imbrue
their hands in blood. At the express command of
James, these ferocious brigands, on the 1st of January
1597, appeared in the streets of Edinburgh, gloating
over the prospect before them, and ready, when their
sovereign gave the word, to sack the capital, and raze
it to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Resistance was hopeless. Whatever
the king demanded, was conceded; and James supposed
that the time was now come, in which he could
firmly establish the authority of the bishops, and, by
their aid, control the clergy, and break their refractory
spirit.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>In this undertaking, three years were consumed. To
insure its success, the king, supported by the nobles,
relied, not only on force, but also on an artifice, which
now seems to have been employed for the first time.
This was, to pack the General Assemblies, by inundating
them with clergymen drawn from the north of Scotland,
where, the old clannish and aristocratic spirit being
supreme, the democratic spirit, found in the south, was
unknown. Hitherto, these northern ministers had rarely
attended at the great meetings of the Church; but
James, in 1597, sent Sir Patrick Murray on a special
mission to them, urging them to be present, in order
that they might vote on his side.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> They, being a very
ignorant body, knowing little or nothing of the questions
really at issue, and being, moreover, accustomed
to a state of society in which men, notwithstanding
their lawlessness, paid the most servile obedience to
their immediate superiors, were easily worked upon, and
induced to do what they were bid. By their help, the
crown and the nobles so strengthened their party in the
General Assembly, as to obtain in many instances a
majority; and innovations were gradually introduced,
calculated to destroy the democratic character of the
Scotch Church.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>In 1597, the movement began. From then, until
1600, successive Assemblies sanctioned different changes,
all of which were marked by that aristocratic tendency
which seemed about to carry everything before it. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
1600, the General Assembly met at Montrose; and
government determined on making a final effort to
compel the Church to establish an episcopal polity.
Andrew Melville, by far the most influential man in
the Church, and the leader of the democratic party, had
been elected, as usual, a member of the Assembly; but
the king, arbitrarily interposing, refused to allow him
to take his seat.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Still, neither by threats, nor by force,
nor by promises, could the court carry their point. All
that they obtained was, that certain ecclesiastics should
be allowed to sit in parliament; but it was ordered that
such persons should every year lay their commissions
at the feet of the General Assembly, and render an
account of their conduct. The Assembly was to have
the power of deposing them; and, to keep them in
greater subjection, they were forbidden to call themselves
bishops, but were to be content with the inferior
title of Commissioners of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>After sustaining this repulse, James seems to have
been disheartened; as he made no further effort, though
he still laboured underhand at the restoration of episcopacy.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
If he had persevered, it might have cost him
his crown. For, his resources were few; he was extremely
poor;<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> and recent events had shown that the
clergy were stronger than he had supposed. When he
thought himself most sure of success, they had subjected
him to a mortifying defeat; and this was the
more remarkable, as it was entirely their own work;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
they being by this time so completely separated from
the nobles, that they could not rely upon even a single
member of that powerful body.</p>

<p>While affairs were in this state, and while the liberties
of Scotland, of which the Church was the guardian,
were trembling in the balance, Elizabeth died, and the
King of Scotland became also King of England. James
at once determined to employ the resources of his new
kingdom to curb his old one. In 1604, that is, only
the year after his accession to the English throne, he
aimed a deadly blow at the Scotch Church, by attacking
the independence of their Assemblies; and, by his own
authority, he prorogued the General Assembly of Aberdeen.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
In 1605, he again prorogued it; and, to make his
intentions clear, he, this time, refused to fix a day for
its future meeting.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Hereupon, some of the ministers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
deputed by presbyteries, took upon themselves to convene
it, which they had an undoubted right to do, as
the act of the king was manifestly illegal. On the day
appointed, they met in the session-house of Aberdeen.
They were ordered to disperse. Having, as they conceived,
by the mere fact of assembling, sufficiently
asserted their privileges, they obeyed. But James, now
backed by the power of England, resolved that they
should feel the change of his position, and, therefore, of
theirs. In consequence of orders which he sent from
London, fourteen of the clergy were committed to
prison.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Six of them, who denied the authority of the
privy-council, were indicted for high treason. They
were at once put upon their trial. They were convicted.
And sentence of death was only deferred, that
the pleasure of the king might first be taken, as to
whether he would not be satisfied with some punishment
that fell short of sacrificing the lives of these
unhappy men.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>Their lives, indeed, were spared; but they were subjected
to a close imprisonment, and then condemned to
perpetual exile.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> In other parts of the country, similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
measures were adopted. Nearly all over Scotland, numbers
of the clergy were either imprisoned or forced to
fly.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Terror and proscription were universal. Such
was the panic, that it was generally believed that
nothing could prevent the permanent establishment of
despotism, unless there were some immediate and providential
interference on behalf of the Church and the
people.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Nor can it be denied that there were plausible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
grounds for these apprehensions. The people had no
friends except among the clergy, and the ablest of the
clergy were either in prison or in exile.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> To deprive
the Church entirely of her leaders, James, in 1606, summoned
to London, Melville and seven of his colleagues,
under pretence of needing their advice.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Having got
possession of their persons, he detained them in England.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
They were forbidden to return to Scotland; and
Melville, who was most feared, was committed to custody.
He was then imprisoned in the Tower, where
he remained four years, and from which he was only
liberated on condition of living abroad, and abandoning
altogether his native country.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The seven ministers
who had accompanied him to London were also imprisoned;
but, being considered less dangerous than their
leader, they, after a time, were allowed to return home.
The nephew of Melville was, however, ordered not to
travel more than two miles from Newcastle; and his
six companions were confined in different parts of
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Everything now seemed ripe for the destruction of
those ideas of equality of which, in Scotland, the Church
was the sole representative. In 1610, a General Assembly
was held at Glasgow; and, as the members of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
were nominated by the crown,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> whatever the government
wished was conceded. By their vote, episcopacy
was established, and the authority of the bishops over
the ministers was fully recognized.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> A little earlier, but
in the same year, two courts of High Commission were
erected, one at Saint Andrews, and one at Glasgow. To
them, all ecclesiastical courts were subordinate. They
were armed with such immense power, that they could
cite any one they pleased before them, could examine
him respecting his religious opinions, could have him
excommunicated, and could fine or imprison him, just
as they thought proper.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Finally, and to complete the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
humiliation of Scotland, the establishment of episcopacy
was not considered complete, until an act was performed,
which nothing but its being very ignominious,
could have saved from being ridiculed as an idle and
childish farce. The archbishop of Glasgow, the bishop
of Brechin, and the bishop of Galloway, had to travel
all the way to London, in order that they might be
touched by some English bishops. Incredible as it may
appear, it was actually supposed that there was no
power in Scotland sufficiently spiritual to turn a Scotchman
into a prelate. Therefore it was, that the archbishop
of Glasgow and his companions performed what
was then an arduous journey to a strange and distant
capital, for the sake of receiving some hidden virtue,
which, on their return home, they might communicate
to their brethren. To the grief and astonishment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
their country, these unworthy priests, abandoning the
traditions of their native land, and forgetting the proud
spirit which animated their fathers, consented to abjure
their own independence, to humble themselves before
the English Church, and to submit to mummeries,
which, in their hearts, they must have despised, but
which were now inflicted upon them by their ancient
and inveterate foes.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>We may easily imagine what would be the future
conduct of men, who, merely for their own aggrandizement,
and to please their prince, could thus renounce
the cherished independence of the Scotch Church. They
who crouch to those who are above them always trample
on those who are below them. Directly they returned to
Scotland, they communicated the consecration they had
received in England to their fellow-bishops,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> who were
of the like mould to themselves, in so far as all of them
aided James in his attempt to subjugate the liberties of
their native country. Being now properly ordained,
their spiritual life was complete; it remained for them to
secure the happiness of their temporal life. This they did,
by gradually monopolizing all authority, and treating
with unsparing severity those who opposed them. The
fall triumph of the bishops was reserved for the reign
of Charles I., when a number of them obtained seats in
the privy-council, where they behaved with such overbearing
insolence, that even Clarendon, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
his notorious partiality for their order, censures their
conduct.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> In the time, however, of James I., they carried
nearly everything before them.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> They deprived
the towns of their privileges, and forced them to receive
magistrates of their own choosing.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> They accumulated
wealth, and made an ostentatious display of it; which
was the more disgraceful, as the country was miserably
poor, and their fellow-subjects were starving around
them.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The Lords of the Articles, without whose sanction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
no measure could be presented to parliament, had
been hitherto elected by laymen; but the bishops now
effected a change, by virtue of which the right of nomination
devolved on themselves.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Having thus gained
possession of the legislature, they obtained the enactment
of fresh penalties against their countrymen. Great
numbers of the clergy they suspended; others they
deprived of their benefices; others they imprisoned.
The city of Edinburgh, being opposed to the rites and
ceremonies lately introduced, and being, like the rest
of the country, hostile to episcopacy, the bishops fell on
it also, displaced several of its magistrates, seized some
of the principal citizens, and threatened to deprive it of
the courts of justice, and of the honour of being the seat
of government.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of all this, and while things seemed to
be at their worst, a great reaction was preparing. And
the explanation of the reaction is to be found in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
vast and pregnant principle, on which I have often insisted,
but which our common historians are unable to
understand; namely, that a bad government, bad laws,
or laws badly administered, are, indeed, extremely injurious
at the time, but can produce no permanent mischief;
in other words, they may harm a country, but
can never ruin it. As long as the people are sound,
there is life, and while there is life, there will be reaction.
In such case, tyranny provokes rebellion, and
despotism causes freedom. But if the people are unsound,
all hope is gone, and the nation perishes. In
both instances, government is, in the long run, inoperative,
and is nowise responsible for the ultimate result.
The ruling classes have, for the moment, immense
power, which they invariably abuse, except when they
are restrained, either by fear, or by shame. The people
may inspire them with fear; public opinion may inspire
them with shame. But whether or not that shall happen,
depends on the spirit of the people, and on the state of
opinion. These two circumstances are themselves governed
by a long chain of antecedents, stretching back
to a period, always very distant, and sometimes so
remote as to baffle observation. When the evidence is
sufficiently abundant, those antecedents may be generalized;
and their generalization conducts us to certain
large and powerful causes, on which the whole
movement depends. In short periods, the operation of
these causes is imperceptible, but in long periods, it is
conspicuous and supreme; it colours the national character;
it controls the great sweep and average of affairs.
In Scotland, as I have already shown, general causes
made the people love their clergy, and made the clergy
love liberty. As long as these two facts coëxisted, the
destiny of the nation was safe. It might be injured,
insulted, and trampled upon. It might be harmed in
various ways; but the greater the harm, the surer the
remedy, because the higher the spirit of the country
would be roused. All that was needed was, a little more
time, and a little more provocation. We, who, standing
at a distance, can contemplate these matters from an
elevation, and see how events pressed on and thickened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
cannot mistake the regularity of their sequence. Notwithstanding
the apparent confusion, all was orderly
and methodical. To us, the scheme is revealed. There
is the fabric, and it is of one hue, and one make. The
pattern is plainly marked, and fortunately it was worked
into a texture, whose mighty web was not to be broken,
either by the arts, or the violence, of designing men.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, of no avail that tyranny did her
utmost. It was of no avail that the throne was occupied
by a despotic and unscrupulous king, who was
succeeded by another, more despotic and more unscrupulous
than himself. It was of no avail that a
handful of meddling and intrusive bishops, deriving
their consecration from London, and supported by the
authority of the English church, took counsel together,
and conspired against the liberties of their native land.
They played the part of spies and of traitors, but they
played it in vain. Yet, everything that government
could give them, it gave. They had the law on their
side, and they had the right of administering the law.
They were legislators, councillors, and judges. They
had wealth; they had high-sounding titles; they had
all the pomp and attributes for which they bartered
their independence, and with which they hoped to
dazzle the eyes of the vulgar. Still, they could not
turn back the stream; they could not even stop it;
they could not prevent it from coming on, and swallowing
them up in its course. Before that generation
passed away, these little men, big though they were in
their own conceit, succumbed, and fell. The hand of
the age was upon them, and they were unable to resist.
They were struck down, and humbled; they were
stripped of their offices, their honours, and their
splendour: they lost all which minds like theirs hold
most dear. Their fate is an instructive lesson. It is a
lesson, both to the rulers of nations, and to those who
write the history of nations. To rulers, in so far as it
is one of many proofs how little they can do, and how
insignificant is the part which they play in the great
drama of the world. To historians, the result should
be especially instructive, as convincing them that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
events on which they concentrate their attention, and
which they believe to be of supreme importance, are in
reality of trifling value, and, so far from holding the
first rank, ought to be made subservient to those large
and comprehensive studies, by whose aid alone, we can
ascertain the conditions which determine the tread and
destiny of nations.</p>

<p>The events that now happened in Scotland, may be
quickly told. The patience of the country was well-nigh
exhausted, and the day of reckoning was at hand.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
In 1637, the people began to rise. In the summer of
that year, the first great riot broke out in Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
The flame quickly spread, and nothing could stop it.
By October, the whole nation was up, and an accusation
was preferred against the bishops, which was signed by
nearly every corporation, and by men of all ranks.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> In
November, the Scotch, in defiance of the Crown,
organized a system of representation of their own, in
which every class had a share.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Early in 1638, the
National Covenant was framed; and the eagerness with
which it was sworn to, showed that the people were
determined, at all hazards, to vindicate their rights.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
It was now evident that all was over. During the
summer of 1638, preparations were made, and, in the
autumn, the storm broke. In November, the first General
Assembly seen in Scotland for twenty years, met at
Glasgow.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The Marquis of Hamilton, the king's commissioner,
ordered the members to separate.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> They
refused.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Nor would they disband, until they had
done the work expected from them.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> By their vote,
the democratic institution of presbyteries was restored
to its old power; the forms of consecration were done
away with; the bishops were degraded from their
functions, and episcopacy was abolished.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>Thus, the bishops fell, even more rapidly than they
had risen.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> As, however, their fall was merely a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of the democratic movement, matters could not stop
there.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Scarcely had the Scotch expelled their
bishops, when they made war upon their king. In 1639,
they took up arms against Charles. In 1640, they
invaded England. In 1641, the king, with the hope of
appeasing them, visited Scotland, and agreed to most
of their demands. It was too late. The people were
hot, and a cry for blood had gone forth. War again
broke out. The Scotch united with the English, and
Charles was every where defeated. As a last chance,
he threw himself upon the mercy of his northern
subjects,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> But his offences were of that rank and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
luxuriant growth, that it was impossible to forgive
them. Indeed, the Scotch, instead of pardoning him,
turned him to profit. He had not only trampled on
their liberties, he had also put them to an enormous
expense. For the injury, he could offer no adequate
atonement; but the expense they had incurred, might
be defrayed. And as it is an old and recognized maxim,
that he who cannot pay with his purse, shall pay with
his body, the Scotch saw no reason why they should
not derive some advantage from the person of their
sovereign, particularly as, hitherto, he had caused them
nothing but loss and annoyance. They, therefore,
gave him up to the English, and, in return, received a
large sum of money, which they claimed as arrears due
to them for the cost of making war on him.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> By this
arrangement, both of the contracting parties benefited.
The Scotch, being very poor, obtained what they most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
lacked. The English, a wealthy people, had indeed to
pay the money, but they were recompensed by getting
hold of their oppressor, against whom they thirsted for
revenge; and they took good care never to let him
loose, until they had exacted the last penalty of his
great and manifold crimes.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>After the execution of Charles I., the Scotch recognized
his son as his successor. But before they would
crown the new king, they subjected him to a treatment
which hereditary sovereigns are not much accustomed
to receive. They made him sign a public declaration,
expressing his regret for what had happened, and
acknowledging that his father, moved by evil counsels,
had unjustly shed the blood of his subjects. He was
also obliged to declare, that by these things he felt
humbled in spirit. He had, moreover, to apologize for
his own errors, which he ascribed partly to his inexperience,
and partly to the badness of his education.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
To evince the sincerity of this confession, and in order
that the confession might be generally known, he was
commanded to keep a day of fasting and humiliation,
in which the whole nation would weep and pray for
him, in the hope that he might escape the consequences
of the sins committed by his family.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>The spirit, of which acts like these are but symptoms,
continued to animate the Scotch during the rest of the
seventeenth century. And fortunately for them it did
so. For, the reigns of Charles II. and James II. were
but repetitions of the reigns of James I. and Charles I.
From 1660 to 1688, Scotland was again subjected to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
tyranny, so cruel, and so exhausting, that it would have
broken the energy of almost any other nation.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The
nobles, whose power had been slowly but constantly
declining,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> were unable to resist the English, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
whom, indeed, they rather seemed willing to combine,
in order that they might have a share in plundering
and oppressing their own country.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> In this, the most
unhappy period through which Scotland had passed
since the fourteenth century, the government was extremely
powerful; the upper classes, crouching before
it, thought only of securing their own safety; the judges
were so corrupt, that justice, instead of being badly
administered, was not administered at all;<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> and the
parliament, completely overawed, consented to what
was termed the recissory act, by which, at a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
stroke, all laws were repealed which had been enacted
since 1633; it being considered that those twenty-eight
years formed an epoch of which the memory should, if
possible, be effaced.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>But, though the higher ranks ignominiously deserted
their post, and destroyed the laws which upheld the
liberties of Scotland, the result proved that the liberties
themselves were indestructible. This was because the
spirit remained, by which the liberties had been won.
The nation was sound at the core; and while that was
the case, legislators could, indeed, abolish the external
manifestations of freedom, but could by no means touch
the causes on which the freedom depended. Liberty was
prostrate, but yet it lived. And the time would surely
come, when a people, who loved it so dearly, would
vindicate their rights. The time would come, when, in
the words of the great poet of English liberty, the nation
would rouse herself like a strong man after sleep, and,
shaking her invincible locks, would be as an eagle muing
her mighty youth, kindling her undazzled eyes at the
midday beam, and purging and unscaling her sight at
the heavenly fountain; while the timorous birds of her
evil destiny, loving the twilight, should flutter about,
amazed at what she meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, the crisis was sad and dangerous. The people,
deserted by every one except their clergy, were ruthlessly
plundered, murdered, and hunted, like wild-beasts,
from place to place. From the tyranny of the bishops,
they had so recently smarted, that they abhorred episcopacy
more than ever; and yet that institution was
not only forced upon them, but government put at its
head Sharp, a cruel and rapacious man, who, in 1661,
was raised to the archbishopric of St. Andrews.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> He
set up a court of ecclesiastical commission, which filled
the prisons to overflowing; and when they would hold
no more, the victims were transported to Barbadoes,
and other unhealthy settlements.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The people, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
determined not to submit to the dictation of government
respecting their religious worship, met together in private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
houses; and, when that was declared illegal, they
fled from their houses to the fields. But there, too, the
bishops were upon them.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Lauderdale, who, for many
years, was at the head of affairs, was greatly influenced
by the new prelates, and aided them with the authority
of the executive.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Under their united auspices, a new
contrivance was hit upon; and a body of soldiers, commanded
by Turner, a drunken and ferocious soldier,
was let loose upon the people.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> The sufferers, galled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to madness, rose in arms. This was made the pretence,
in 1667, for fresh military executions, by which some of
the fairest parts of western Scotland were devastated,
houses burned, men tortured, women ravished.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> In
1670, an act of parliament was passed, declaring that
whoever preached in the fields without permission should
be put to death.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Some lawyers were found bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
enough to defend innocent men, when they were tried
for their lives; it was therefore determined to silence
them also, and, in 1674, a great part of the Faculty of
Advocates was expelled from Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> In 1678,
by the express command of government, the Highlanders
were brought down from their mountains, and, during
three months, were encouraged to slay, plunder, and
burn at their pleasure, the inhabitants of the most
populous and industrious parts of Scotland. For centuries,
the bitterest animosity had existed between the
Highlanders and Lowlanders; and now these savage
mountaineers were called from their homes, that they
might take full revenge. And well they glutted their
ire. During three months, they enjoyed every license.
Eight thousand<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> armed Highlanders, invited by the
English government, and receiving beforehand an indemnity
for every excess,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> were left to work their will
upon the towns and villages of Western Scotland. They
spared neither age nor sex. They deprived the people
of their property; they even stripped them of their
clothes, and sent them out naked to die in the fields.
Upon many, they inflicted the most horrible tortures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Children, torn from their mothers, were foully abused;
while both mothers and daughters were subjected to a
fate, compared to which death would have been a joyful
alternative.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>It was in this way, that the English government
sought to break the spirit, and to change the opinions,
of the Scotch people. The nobles looked on in silence,
and, so far from resisting, had not even the courage to
remonstrate. The parliament was equally servile, and
sanctioned whatever the government demanded. Still,
the people were firm. Their clergy, drawn from the
middle classes, clung to them; they clung to their clergy,
and both were unchanged. The bishops were hated as
allies of the government, and were with reason regarded
as public enemies. They were known to have favoured,
and often to have suggested, the atrocities which had
been committed;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and they were so pleased with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
punishment inflicted upon their opponents, that no one
was surprised, when, a few years later, they, in an
address to James II., the most cruel of all the Stuarts,
declared that he was the darling of heaven, and hoped
that God might give him the hearts of his subjects, and
the necks of his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>The character of the prince, whom the bishops thus
delighted to honour, is now well understood. Horrible
as were the crimes which had been perpetrated, they
were surpassed by what occurred, when he, in 1680,
assumed the direction of affairs.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> He had worked
himself to that pitch of iniquity, as to derive actual
enjoyment from witnessing the agonies of his fellow-creatures.
This is an abyss of wickedness, into which
even the most corrupt natures rarely fall. There have
been, and always will be, many men who care nothing
for human suffering, and who will inflict any amount of
pain, in order to gain certain ends. But to take delight
in the spectacle, is a peculiar and hideous abomination.
James, however, was so dead to shame, that he did not
care even to conceal his horrible tastes. Whenever
torture was inflicted, he was sure to be present, feasting
his eyes, and revelling with a fiendish joy.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> It makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
our flesh creep to think that such a man should have
been the ruler of millions. But what shall we say to
the Scotch bishops, who applauded him, of whose conduct
they were daily witnesses? Where can we find
language strong enough to stigmatize those recreant
priests, who, having passed years in attempting to subjugate
the liberties of their country, did, towards the
close of their career, and just before their final fall,
band together, and employ their united authority, as
ministers of a holy and peaceful religion, to stamp with
public approval, a prince, whose malignant cruelty made
him loathed by his contemporaries, and whose revolting
predilections, unless we ascribe them to a diseased brain,
are not only a slur upon the age which tolerated them,
but a disgrace to the higher instincts of our common
nature?</p>

<p>So utterly corrupt, however, were the ruling classes
in Scotland, that such crimes seem hardly to have excited
indignation. The sufferers were refractory subjects,
and against them every thing was lawful. The
usual torture, which was called the torture of the boots,
was to place the leg in a frame, into which wedges were
driven, until the bones were broken.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> But when James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
visited Scotland, an opinion began to grow up, that this
was too lenient, and that other means must be devised.
The spirit which he communicated to his subordinates,
animated his immediate successors, and, in 1684, during
his absence, a new instrument was introduced, termed
the thumbikins. This was composed of small steel
screws, arranged with such diabolical art, that not
only the thumb, but also the whole hand, could be compressed
by them, producing pain more exquisite than
any hitherto known, and having, moreover, the advantage
of not endangering life; so that the torture could
be frequently repeated on the same person.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>After this, little more need be said.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> From the mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
mention of such things, the mind recoils with disgust.
The reader of the history of that time sickens and faints
at the contrivances by which these abject creatures
sought to stifle public opinion, and to ruin, for ever, a
gallant and high-spirited people. But now, as before,
they laboured in vain. More yet was, however, to be
borne. The short reign of James II. was ushered in by
an act of singular barbarity. A few weeks after this
bad man came to the throne, all the children in Annandale
and Nithsdale, between the ages of six and ten,
were seized by the soldiers, separated from their parents,
and threatened with immediate death.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The next step
was, to banish, by wholesale, large numbers of adults,
who were shipped off to unhealthy settlements; many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of the men first losing their ears, and the women being
branded, some on the hand, some on the cheek.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Those,
however, who remained behind, were equal to the
emergency, and were ready to do what remained to be
done. In 1688, as in 1642, the Scotch people and the
English people united against their common oppressor,
who saved himself by sudden and ignominious flight.
He was a coward as well as a despot, and from him there
was no further danger. The bishops, indeed, loved
him; but they were an insignificant body, and had
enough to do to look to themselves. His only powerful
friends were the Highlanders. That barbarous race
thought, with regret, of those bygone days when the
government had not only allowed them, but had ordered
them, to plunder and oppress their southern neighbours.
For this purpose, Charles II. had availed himself of their
services; and it could hardly be doubted, that if the
Stuart dynasty were restored, they would be again employed,
and would again enrich themselves by pillaging
the Lowlanders.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> War was their chief amusement; it
was also their livelihood; and it was the only thing that
they understood.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Besides this, the mere fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
James no longer possessed authority, wonderfully increased
their loyalty towards him. The Highlanders
flourished by rapine, and traded in anarchy.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> They,
therefore, hated any government which was strong
enough to punish crime; and the Stuarts being now far
away, this nation of thieves loved them with an ardour
which nothing but their absence could have caused.
From William III., they feared restraint; but the exiled
prince could do them no hurt, and would look on
their excesses as the natural result of their zeal. Not
that they cared about the principle of monarchical succession,
or speculated on the doctrine of divine right.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
The only succession that interested them, was that of
their chiefs. Their only notion of right, was to do what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
those chiefs commanded. Being miserably poor,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> they,
in raising a rebellion, risked nothing except their lives,
of which, in that state of society, men are always reckless.
If they failed, they encountered a speedy, and, as
they deemed it, an honourable death. If they succeeded,
they gained fame and wealth. In either case, they were
sure of many enjoyments. They were sure of being
able, for a time at least, to indulge in pillage and murder,
and to practise, without restraint, those excesses
which they regarded as the choicest guerdon of a
soldier's career.</p>

<p>So far, therefore, from wondering at the rebellions
of 1715 and 1745,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> the only wonder is, that they did
not break out sooner, and that they were not better
supported. In 1745, when the sudden appearance of
the rebels struck England with terror, and when they
penetrated even to the heart of the kingdom, their
numbers, even at their height, including Lowland and
English recruits, never reached six thousand men. The
ordinary amount was five thousand;<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and they cared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
so little about the cause for which they professed to
fight, that, in 1715, when they numbered much stronger
than in 1745, they refused to enter England, and make
head against the government, until they were bribed
by the promise of additional pay.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> So, too, in 1745,
after they had won the battle of Preston-pans, the only
result of that great victory was, that the Highlanders,
instead of striking a fresh blow, deserted in large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
bodies, that they might secure the booty they had
obtained, and which alone they valued. They heeded
not whether Stuart or Hanoverian gained the day; and
at this critical moment, they were unable, says the
historian, to resist their desire to return to their glens,
and decorate their huts with the spoil.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>There are, indeed, few things more absurd than that
lying spirit of romance, which represents the rising of
the Highlanders as the outburst of a devoted loyalty.
Nothing was further from their minds than this. The
Highlanders have crimes enough to account for, without
being burdened by needless reproach. They were
thieves and murderers; but that was in their way of
life, and they felt not the stigma. Though they were
ignorant and ferocious, they were not so foolish as to
be personally attached to that degraded family, which,
before the accession of William III., occupied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
throne of Scotland. To love such men as Charles II.
and James II., may, perhaps, be excused as one of those
peculiarities of taste of which one sometimes hears.
But to love all their descendants; to feel an affection so
comprehensive as to take in the whole dynasty, and, for
the sake of gratifying that eccentric passion, not only
to undergo great hardships, but to inflict enormous
evil upon two kingdoms, would have been a folly as well
as a wickedness, and would convict the Highlanders of
a species of insanity alien to their nature. They burst
into insurrection, because insurrection suited their
habits, and because they hated all government and all
order.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> But, so far from caring for a monarch, the
very institution of monarchy was repulsive to them.
It was contrary to that spirit of clanship to which they
were devoted; and, from their earliest childhood, they
were accustomed to respect none but their chiefs, to
whom they paid a willing obedience, and whom they
considered far superior to all the potentates of the
earth.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> No one, indeed, who is really acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
their history, will think them capable of having spilt
their blood on behalf of any sovereign, be he whom he
might; still less can we believe that they would quit
their native land, and undertake long and hazardous
marches, with the object of restoring that corrupt and
tyrannical dynasty, whose offences smelt to heaven, and
whose cruelties had, at length, kindled the anger even
of humble and meek-minded men.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, that the outbreaks of 1715 and
1745 were, in our country, the last struggle of barbarism
against civilization. On the one side, war
and confusion. On the other side, peace and prosperity.
These were the interests for which men
really fought; and neither party cared for Stuarts or
for Hanoverians. The result of such a contest in the
eighteenth century, could hardly be doubtful. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
time, the rebellions caused great alarm, both from their
suddenness, and from the strange and ferocious appearance
of the Highland invaders.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> But the knowledge
we now possess, enables us to see, that, from the
beginning, success was impossible. Though the government
was extremely remiss, and, notwithstanding the
information it received, allowed itself on both occasions
to be taken by surprise, there was no real danger.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
The English, not being particularly enamoured either
with the Highlanders or with the Stuarts, refused to
rise;<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> and it cannot be seriously supposed, that a few
thousand half-naked banditti had it in their power to
prescribe to the people of England what sovereign they
should obey, and under what sort of government they
should live.</p>

<p>After 1745, there was no further interruption. The
interests of civilization, that is, the interests of knowledge,
of liberty, and of wealth, gradually assumed the
upper hand, and reduced men like the Highlanders to
utter insignificance. Roads were cut through their
country; and, for the first time, travellers from the
south began to mingle with them in their hitherto
inaccessible wilds.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> In those parts, the movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
was, indeed, very slow; but, in the Lowlands, it was
much more rapid. For, the traders and inhabitants
of towns were now becoming prominent, and their
authority helped to neutralize the old warlike and
anarchical habits. Towards the end of the seventeenth
century, a taste for commercial speculation sprung up,
and a large amount of the energy of Scotland was
turned into this new channel.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Early in the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
century, the same tendency was displayed in literature;
and works on mercantile and economical subjects
became common.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> A change in manners was also
perceptible. About this period, the Scotch began to
lose something of that rugged ferocity which had
distinguished them of old. This improvement was
evinced in several ways; one of the most remarkable
being an alteration, which was first observed in 1710,
when it was noticed that men were leaving off armour,
which had hitherto been worn by every one who could
afford it, as a useful precaution in a barbarous, and
therefore a warlike society.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>To trace the general progress in its various parts, or
even to indicate the immediate consequences, would require
a separate volume. One of the results is, however,
too conspicuous to be passed over in silence, though it
does not deserve all the importance that has been attached
to it. This is, the abolition of hereditary jurisdictions,
which, after all, was but a symptom of the great movement,
and not a cause of it; being itself due, partly to
the growth of the industrial spirit, and partly to that
diminution of the power of the aristocracy, which had
been visible as early as the beginning of the seventeenth
century. During many ages, certain persons of noble
birth had enjoyed the privilege of trying offences, and
even of inflicting capital punishment, simply because
their ancestors had done so before them; the judicial
power being, in fact, part of their patrimony, and descending
to them like the rest of their property.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
institution of this sort, which made a man a judge, not
because he was apt for the office, but because he was
born under particular circumstances, was a folly which
the revolutionary temper of the eighteenth century was
not likely to spare. The innovating spirit for which
that age was remarkable, could hardly fail to attack so
preposterous a custom; and its extinction was facilitated,
both by the decline of the nobles who possessed the
privilege, and by the rise of their natural opponents, the
trading and commercial classes. The decay of the
Scotch nobility, in the eighteenth century, may be
traced to two special causes, in addition to those general
causes, which were weakening the aristocracy nearly
all over Europe. With the general causes, which
were common to England and to most parts of the
Continent, we are not now concerned. It is enough
to say, that they were entirely dependent on that advance
of knowledge, which, by increasing the authority
of the intellectual class, undermines, and must eventually
overthrow, mere hereditary and accidental distinctions.
But those causes which were confined to
Scotland, had a more political character, and though
they were purely local, they harmonized with the
whole train of events, and ought to be noticed, as links
of a vast chain, which connects the present state of
that singular country with its past history.</p>

<p>The first cause was the union of Scotland with England,
in 1707, which struck a heavy blow at the Scotch
aristocracy. By it, the legislature of the smaller country
was absorbed in that of the larger, and the hereditary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
legislators suddenly sunk into insignificance. In the
Scotch parliament, there were a hundred and forty-five
peers, all of whom, except sixteen, were, by the Act of
Union, deprived of the power of making laws.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> These
sixteen were sent off to London, and took their seats in
the House of Lords, of which they formed a small and
miserable fraction. On every subject, however important
to their own country, they were easily outvoted;
their manners, their gesticulations, and particularly
their comical mode of pronouncing English, were openly
ridiculed;<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and the chiefs of this old and powerful
aristocracy found themselves, to their utter amazement,
looked on as men of no account, and they were often
obliged to fawn and cringe at the levee of the minister,
in order to procure a place for some needy dependent.
Their friends and relations applied to them for offices,
and generally applied in vain. Indeed, the Scotch
nobles, being very poor, wanted for themselves more
than the English government was inclined to give, and,
in the eagerness of their clamour, they lost both dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and reputation.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> They were exposed to mortifying
rebuffs, and their true position being soon known,
weakened their influence at home, among a people
already prepared to throw off their authority. To this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
however, they were comparatively indifferent, as they
looked for future fortune, not to Scotland, but to England.
London became the centre of their intrigues and
their hopes.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Those who had no seat in the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Lords, longed to have one, and it was notorious, that
the darling object of nearly every Scotch noble was to
be made an English peer.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> The scene of their ambition
being shifted, they were gradually weaned from
their old associations. Directly this was apparent, the
foundation of their power was gone. From that moment,
their real nationality vanished. It became evident
that their patriotism was but a selfish passion. They
ceased to love a country which could give them nothing,
and, as a natural consequence, their country ceased to
love them.</p>

<p>Thus it was that this great tie was severed. In this,
as in all similar movements, there were, of course, exceptions.
Some of the nobles were disinterested, and
some of their dependents were faithful. But, looking
at the Lowlands as a whole, there can be no doubt that,
before the middle of the eighteenth century, that bond
of affection was gone, which, in former times, made
tens of thousands of Scotchmen ready to follow their
superiors in any cause, and to sacrifice their lives at a
nod. That spirit, which was once deemed ardent and
generous, but which a deeper analysis shows to be mean
and servile, was now almost extinct, except among the
barbarous Highlanders, whose ignorance of affairs long
prevented them from being influenced by the stream of
events. That the proximate cause of this change was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the Union, will probably be denied by no one who has
minutely studied the history of the period. And that
the change was beneficial, can only be questioned by
those sentimental dreamers, with whom life is a matter
rather of feeling than of judgment, and who, despising
real and tangible interests, reproach their own age with
its material prosperity, and with its love of luxury, as
if they were the result of low and sordid desires unknown
to the loftier temper of bygone days. To
visionaries of this sort, it may well appear that the
barbarous and ignorant noble, surrounded by a host of
devoted retainers, and living with rude simplicity in his
own dull and wretched castle, forms a beautiful picture
of those unmercenary and uncalculating times, when
men, instead of seeking for knowledge, or for wealth,
or for comfort, were content with the frugal innocence
of their fathers, and when, protection being accorded
by one class, and gratitude felt by the other, the subordination
of society was maintained, and its different
parts were knit together by sympathy, and by the force
of common emotions, instead of, as now, by the coarse
maxims of a vulgar and selfish utility.</p>

<p>Those, however, whose knowledge gives them some
acquaintance with the real course of human affairs, will
see that in Scotland, as in all civilized countries, the
decline of aristocratic power forms an essential part of
the general progress. It must, therefore, be esteemed
a fortunate circumstance, that, among the Scotch, where
that power had long been enormous, it was weakened
in the eighteenth century, not only by general causes,
which were operating elsewhere, but also by two smaller
and more special causes. The first of these minor
causes was, as we have just seen, the Union with England.
The other cause was, comparatively speaking,
insignificant, but still it produced decided effect, particularly
in the northern districts. It consisted in the
fact, that some of the oldest Highland nobles were
concerned in the rebellion of 1745, and that, when that
rebellion was put down, those who escaped from the
sword were glad to save their lives by flying abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
leaving their dependents to shift for themselves.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
They became attached to the court of the Pretender, or,
at all events, intrigued for him. That, indeed, was their
only chance, their estates at home being forfeited. For
nearly forty years, several great families were in exile,
and although, about 1784, they began to return,<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> other
associations had been formed during their absence, and
new ideas had arisen, both in their own minds, and in
the minds of their retainers. A fresh generation had
grown up, and fresh influences had been brought to
bear. Strangers, with whom the people had no sympathy,
had intruded upon the estates of the nobles,
and though they might receive obedience, it was an
obedience unaccompanied by deference. The real reverence
was gone; the homage of the heart was no
more. And as this state of things lasted for about
forty years, it interrupted the whole train of thought;
and the former habits were so completely broken, that,
even when the chiefs were restored to their forfeited
honours, they found that there was another part of their
inheritance which they were unable to recover, and that
they had lost for ever that unreserved submission,
which, in times of yore, had been willingly paid to their
fathers.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to these circumstances, the course of affairs in
Scotland, during the eighteenth century, and especially
during the first half of it, was marked by a more rapid
decline of the influence of the higher ranks than was
seen in any other country. It was, therefore, an easy
task for the English government to procure a law,
which, by abolishing hereditary jurisdictions, deprived
the Scotch aristocracy, in 1748, of the last great ensign
of their power.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> The law, being suited to the spirit
of the times, worked well; and in the Highlands, in
particular, it was one immediate cause of the establishment
of something like the order of a settled state.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
But in this instance, as in every other, the real and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
overruling cause is to be found in the condition of the
surrounding society. A few generations earlier, hardly
any one would have thought of abolishing these mischievous
jurisdictions, which were then deemed beneficial,
and were respected, as belonging to the great
families by natural and inalienable right. Such an
opinion was the inevitable result of the state of things
then existing. This being the case, it is certain that, if
the legislature had, at that time, been so rash as to lay
its hand on what the nation respected, popular sympathy
would have been aroused, and the nobles would
have been strengthened by what was intended to weaken
them.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> In 1748, however, matters were very different.
Public opinion had changed; and this change of opinion
was not only the cause of the new law, but was the
reason of the new law being effective. And so it
always is. They, indeed, whose knowledge is almost
confined to what they see passing around them, and
who, on account of their ignorance, are termed practical
men, may talk as they will about the reforms which
government has introduced, and the improvement to be
expected from legislation. But whoever will take a
wider and more commanding view of affairs, will soon
discover that such hopes are chimerical. They will
learn that lawgivers are nearly always the obstructors
of society, instead of its helpers; and that, in the extremely
few cases in which their measures have turned
out well, their success has been owing to the fact, that,
contrary to their usual custom, they have implicitly
obeyed the spirit of their time, and have been, as they
always should be, the mere servants of the people, to
whose wishes they are bound to give a public and legal
sanction.</p>

<p>Another striking peculiarity of Scotland, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
remarkable period we are now considering, was the
sudden rise of trading and manufacturing interests.
This preceded, by a whole generation, the celebrated
statute of 1748, and was one of the causes of it, in so
far as it weakened the great families, against whom
that statute was directed. The movement may be traced
back, as I have already noticed, to the end of the
seventeenth century, and it was in active operation
before the first twenty years of the eighteenth century
had passed away. A mercantile and money-making
spirit was diffused to an extent formerly unknown, and
men becoming valued for their wealth as well as for
their birth, a new standard of excellence was introduced,
and new actors appeared on the scene. Heretofore,
persons were respected solely for their parentage; now
they were also respected for their riches. The old
aristocracy, made uneasy by the change, did every
thing they could to thwart and discourage these young
and dangerous rivals.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Nor can we wonder at their
feeling somewhat sore. The tendency which was exhibited,
was, indeed, fatal to their pretensions. Instead
of asking who was a man's father, the question became,
how much he had got. And certainly, if either question
is to be put, the latter is the more rational. Wealth is
a real and substantial thing, which ministers to our
pleasures, increases our comfort, multiplies our resources,
and not unfrequently alleviates our pains. But birth
is a dream and a shadow, which, so far from benefiting
either body or mind, only puffs up its possessor with an
imaginary excellence, and teaches him to despise those
whom nature has made his superiors, and who, whether
engaged in adding to our knowledge or to our wealth,
are, in either case, ameliorating the condition of society,
and rendering to it true and valuable service.</p>

<p>This antagonism between the aristocratic and trading
spirit, lies in the nature of things, and is essential,
however it may be disguised at particular periods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Therefore it is, that the history of trade has a philosophic
importance in reference to the progress of society, quite
independent of practical considerations. On this account
I have called the attention of the reader to what
otherwise would be foreign to the objects of the present
Introduction; and I will now trace, as briefly as possible,
the beginning of that great industrial movement,
to the extension of which the overthrow of the Scotch
aristocracy is to be partly ascribed.</p>

<p>The Union with England, which was completed in
1707, produced immediate and striking effects on trade.
Its first effect was, to throw open to the Scotch a new
and extensive commerce with the English colonies in
America. Before the Union, no goods of any kind could
be landed in Scotland from the American plantations,
unless they had first been landed in England, and paid
duty there; nor even, in that case, might they be conveyed
by any Scotch vessel.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> This was one of many
foolish regulations by which our legislators interfered
with the natural course of affairs, and injured the interests
of their own country, as well as those of their
neighbours. Formerly, however, such laws were considered
to be extremely sagacious, and politicians were
constantly contriving protective schemes of this sort,
which, with the best intentions, inflicted incalculable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
harm. But if, as seems probable, one of their objects, in
this instance, was to retard the improvement of Scotland,
they were more than usually successful in effecting the
purpose at which they aimed. For, the whole of the
western coast, being cut off from direct intercourse with
the American colonies, was debarred from the only
foreign trade it could advantageously follow; since the
European ports lay to the east, and could not be reached
by the inhabitants of Western Scotland without a long
circumnavigation, which prevented them from competing,
on equal terms, with their countrymen, who,
sailing from the other side, were already near the chief
seats of commerce. The consequence was, that Glasgow
and the other western ports remained almost stationary;
having comparatively few means of gratifying that enterprising
spirit, which rose among them late in the
seventeenth century, and not daring to trade with those
prosperous colonies which were just before them across
the Atlantic, but from which they were entirely excluded
by the jealous precautions of the English parliament.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>When, however, by the Act of Union, the two countries
became one, these precautions were discontinued,
and Scotland was allowed to hold direct intercourse
with America and the West India Islands. The result
which this produced on the national industry, was almost
instantaneous, because it gave vent to a spirit which
had begun to appear among the people late in the
seventeenth century, and because it was aided by those
still more general causes, which, in most parts of
Europe, predisposed that age to increased industry.
The west of Scotland, being nearest to America, was the
first to feel the movement. In 1707, the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Greenock, without the interference of government, imposed
on themselves a voluntary assessment, with the
object of constructing a harbour. In this undertaking,
they displayed so much zeal, that, by the year 1710,
the whole of the works were completed; a pier and
capacious harbour were erected, and Greenock was
suddenly raised from insignificance to take an important
part in the trade of the Atlantic.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> For a while, the
merchants were content to carry on their traffic with
ships hired from the English. Soon, however, they
became bolder; they began to build on their own
account; and, in 1719, the first vessel belonging to
Greenock sailed for America.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> From that moment, their
commerce increased so rapidly, that, by the year 1740, the
tax which the citizens had laid on themselves sufficed,
not only to wipe off the debt which had been incurred,
but also to leave a considerable surplus available
for municipal purposes.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> At the same time, and by
the action of the same causes, Glasgow emerged from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
obscurity. In 1718, its enterprising inhabitants launched
in the Clyde the first Scotch vessel which ever crossed
the Atlantic; thus anticipating the people of Greenock
by one year.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Glasgow and Greenock became the two
great commercial outlets of Scotland, and the chief
centres of activity.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Comforts, and, indeed, luxuries,
hitherto only attainable at enormous cost, began to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
diffused through the country. The productions of the
tropics could now be procured direct from the New
World, which, in return, offered a rich and abundant
market for manufactured goods. This was a further
stimulus to Scotch industry, and its effects were immediately
apparent. The inhabitants of Glasgow, finding
a great demand among the Americans for linen, introduced
its manufacture into their city in 1725, whence it
extended to other places, and, in a short time, gave
employment to thousands of workmen.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> It is also
from the year 1725, that Paisley dates its rise. So late
as the beginning of the eighteenth century, this rich
and prosperous city was still a straggling village, containing
only a single street.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> But, after the Union,
its poor, and hitherto idle, inhabitants began to be
moved by the activity which they saw on every side.
Gradually, their views expanded; and the introduction
among them, in 1725, of the manufacture of thread,
was the first step in that great career in which they
never stopped, until they had raised Paisley to be a vast
emporium of industry, and a successful promoter of
every art by which industry is nurtured.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was it merely in the west, that this movement
was displayed. In Scotland generally, the spirit of
trade became so rife, that it began to encroach on the
old theological spirit, which had long been supreme.
Hitherto, the Scotch had cared for little except religious
polemics. In every society, these had been the
chief subjects of conversation; and on them, men had
wasted their energies, without the least benefit either
to themselves or to others. But, about this time it was
observed, that the improvement of manufactures became
a common topic of discourse.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Such a statement,
made by a well-informed writer, who witnessed what
he relates, is a curious proof of the change which was
beginning, though very faintly, to steal over the Scotch
mind. It shows that there was, at all events, a tendency
to turn aside from subjects which are inaccessible
to our understanding, and the discussion of which has
no effect except to exasperate those who dispute, and to
make them more intolerant than ever of theological
opinions different from their own. Unhappily, there
were, as I shall presently point out, other causes at
work, which prevented this tendency from producing
all the good that might have been expected. Still, so
far as it went, it was a clear gain. It was a blow to
superstition, inasmuch as it was an attempt to occupy
the human mind with mere secular considerations. In
a country like Scotland, this alone was extremely
important. We must also add, that, though it was
the effect of increased industry, it, as often happens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
reacted upon, and strengthened, its cause. For, by diminishing,
however little, the inordinate respect formerly
paid to theological pursuits, it was, in the same proportion,
an inducement to ambitious and enterprising
men to abstain from those pursuits, and to engage in
temporal matters, where ability, being less fettered by
prejudice, has more scope, and enjoys more freedom of
action. Of those men, some rose to the first rank in
literature; while others, taking a different but equally
useful turn, became as eminent in trade. Hence, Scotland,
during the eighteenth century, possessed, for the
first time, two powerful and active classes, whose aim
was essentially secular&mdash;the intellectual class, and the
industrial class. Before the eighteenth century, neither
of these classes exercised an independent sway, or could,
indeed, be said to have a separate existence. The intellect
of the country was absorbed by the church; the
industry of the country was controlled by the nobles.
The effect which this change produced on the literature
of Scotland will be traced in the last chapter of the
present volume. Its effect on industry was equally
remarkable, and, for the well-being of the nation, was
equally valuable. But it does not possess that general
scientific interest which belongs to the intellectual
movement; and I shall, therefore, in addition to the
evidence already given, confine myself to a few more
facts illustrative of the history of Scotch industry down
to the middle of the eighteenth century, by which time
there was no longer any doubt that the flood of material
prosperity had fairly set in.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century, the only Scotch
manufacture of any importance was that of linen, which,
however, like every other branch of industry, was
very backward, and was exposed to all sorts of discouragement.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
But, after the Union, it received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
sudden impetus, from two causes. One of these causes,
as I have already noticed, was the demand from America,
consequent upon the trade of the Atlantic being
thrown open. The other cause was, the removal of the
duty which England had imposed upon the importation
of Scotch linen. These two circumstances, occurring
nearly at the same time, produced such effect on
the national industry, that De Foe, who had a wider
knowledge of the details of trade than any man of
that age, said that it seemed as if, for the future, the
Scotch poor could never lack employment.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Unfortunately,
this was not the case, and never will be, until
society is radically changed. But the movement which
provoked so bold a remark from so cautious an observer
as De Foe, must have been very striking; and we know,
from other sources, that, between 1728 and 1738, the
manufacture of linen for exportation alone was more
than doubled.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> After that period, this and other
departments of Scotch industry advanced with a constantly
accelerating speed. It is mentioned, by a contemporary
who was likely to be well informed, that,
between 1715 and 1745, the trade and manufactures
of Scotland increased more than they had done for
ages before.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Such a statement, though valuable as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
corroborating other evidence, is too vague to be entirely
relied on; and historians, who usually occupy themselves
with insignificant details about courts and princes
and statesmen, desert us in matters which are really
important, so that it is now hardly possible to reconstruct
the history of the Scotch people during this,
the first epoch of their material prosperity. I have,
however, gathered a few facts, which appear to rest on
good authority, and which supply us with something
like precise information as to dates. In 1739, the manufacture
of linen was introduced into Kilbarchan,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> and,
in 1740, into Arbroath.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> From the year 1742, the manufactures
of Kilmarnock date their rise.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> In 1748,
the first linen was manufactured in Cullen;<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> and in the
same year in Inverary.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> In 1749, this great branch of
industry and source of wealth was established, on a large
scale, in Aberdeen;<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> while, about 1750, it began to diffuse
itself in Wemyss, in the county of Fife.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> These
things happening, within eleven years, in parts of the
country so distant from each other, and so totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
unconnected, indicate the existence of general causes,
which governed the whole movement; though in this,
as in all instances, every thing is popularly ascribed to
the influence of a few powerful individuals. We have,
however, other proofs that the progress was essentially
national. Even in Edinburgh, where hitherto no
claims had been respected except those of the nobles or
clergy, the voice of this new trading interest began to
be heard. In that poor and warlike capital, a society
was now first established for the encouragement of manufactures;
and we are assured that this was but a
single manifestation of the enthusiasm which was generally
felt on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Coinciding with this movement,
and indeed forming part of it, we can discern the
earliest symptoms of a monied class, properly so called.
In 1749, there was established, at Aberdeen, the first
county bank ever seen in Scotland; and, in the very
same year, a similar establishment was formed at Glasgow.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
These represented the east and the west, and,
by the advances which they were able to make, each
assisted the trade of its own district. Between eastern
and western Scotland, the intercourse, as yet, was
difficult and costly. But this likewise was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
be remedied by an enterprise, the mere conception of
which would formerly have excited ridicule. After the
Union, the idea arose of uniting the east with the west
by a canal, which should join the Forth to the Clyde.
The plan was deemed chimerical, and was abandoned.
As soon, however, as the manufacturing and commercial
classes had gained sufficient influence they adopted it,
with that energy which is characteristic of their order,
and which is more common among them than among
any other rank of society. The result was, that, in
1768, the great work was fairly begun;<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> and the first
step was taken towards what, in a material point of
view, was an enterprise of vast importance, but, in a
social and intellectual point of view, was of still superior
value, inasmuch as, by supplying a cheap and easy
transit through the heart of the most populous part of
Scotland, it had a direct tendency to make different districts
and different places feel that each had need of
others, and thus encouraging the notion that all belonged
to one common scheme, it assisted in diminishing
local prejudice and assuaging local jealousy; while,
in the same proportion, by enticing men to move out of
the narrow circle in which they had habitually lived, it
prepared them for a certain enlargement of mind, which
is the natural consequence of seeing affairs under various
aspects, and which is never found in any country in
which the means of travelling are either very hazardous
or very expensive.</p>

<p>Such was the state of Scotland towards the middle
of the eighteenth century; and surely a fairer prospect
was never opened to any country. The land was at
peace. It had nothing to fear, either from foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
invasion, or from domestic tyranny. The arts, which
increase the comfort of man, and minister to his happiness,
were sedulously cultivated; wealth was being
created with unexampled speed, and the blessings which
follow in the train of wealth were being widely diffused;
while the insolence of the nobility was so effectually
curbed, that industrious citizens could, for the first time,
feel their own independence, could know that what they
earned, that likewise they should enjoy, and could hold
themselves erect, and with a manly brow, in the presence
of a class before whom they had long crouched in abject
submission.</p>

<p>Besides this, a great literature now arose, a literature
of rare and surpassing beauty. To narrate the intellectual
achievements of the Scotch during the eighteenth
century, in a manner at all commensurate with their
importance, would require a separate treatise, and I
cannot now stop even to mention what all educated
persons are at least partly acquainted with; each student
recognizing the value of what was done in his own pursuit.
In the last chapter of this volume, I shall, however,
attempt to give some idea of the general results
considered as a whole; at present, it is enough to say,
that in every branch of knowledge this once poor
and ignorant people produced original and successful
thinkers. What makes this the more remarkable, is its
complete contrast to their former state. Down even to
the beginning of the eighteenth century, Scotland could
only boast of two authors whose works have benefited
mankind. They were Buchanan and Napier. Buchanan
was the first political writer who held accurate views
respecting government, and who clearly defined the true
relation between the people and their rulers. He placed
popular rights on a solid basis, and vindicated, by anticipation,
all subsequent revolutions. Napier, equally
bold in another department, succeeded, by a mighty
effort of genius, in detecting, and pushing to its extreme
consequence, a law of the progression of numbers, which
is so simple and yet so potent, that it unravels the most
tedious and intricate calculations, and, thus economizing
the labours of the brain, has saved an enormous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
incalculable waste. These two men were, indeed, great
benefactors of their species; but they stand alone, and
if all the other authors Scotland produced down to the
close of the seventeenth century had never been born, or
if, being born, they had never written, society would
have lost nothing, but would be in exactly the same
position as it now is.</p>

<p>Early, however, in the eighteenth century, a movement
was felt all over Europe, and in that movement
Scotland participated. A spirit of inquiry was abroad,
so general and so searching, that no country could
entirely escape from its action. Sanguine men were
excited, and even grave men were stirred. It seemed
as if a long night were about to close. Light broke
forth where before there was nothing but darkness.
Opinions which had stood the test of ages were suddenly
questioned; and in every direction doubts sprung up,
and proofs were demanded. The human mind, waxing
bold, would not be satisfied with the old evidence.
Things were examined at their foundation, and the
basis of every belief was jealously scrutinized. For a
time, this was confined to the higher intellects; but
soon the movement spread, and, in the most advanced
countries, worked upon nearly all classes. In England
and in France, the result was extremely beneficial. It
might have been hoped, that in Scotland likewise, the
popular mind would gradually have become enlightened.
But not so. Time rolled on; one generation succeeded
another; the eighteenth century passed away; the nineteenth
century came; and still the people made no sign.
The gloom of the middle ages was yet upon them.
While all around was light, the Scotch, enveloped in
mist, crept on, groping their way, dismally and with
fear. While other nations were shaking off their old
superstitions, this singular people clung to theirs with
undiminished tenacity. Now, indeed, their grasp is
gradually slackening, but with extreme slowness, and
threatening reactions frequently appear. This, as it
always has been, and still is, the curse of Scotland, so
also is it the chief difficulty with which the historian of
Scotland has to contend. Everywhere else, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
rise of the intellectual classes, and that of the trading and
manufacturing classes, have accompanied each other,
the invariable result has been, a diminution of the power
of the clergy, and, consequently, a diminution of the influence
of superstition. The peculiarity of Scotland is,
that, during the eighteenth century, and even down to
the middle of the nineteenth century, the industrial and
intellectual progress has continued without materially
shaking the authority of the priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Strange
and unequal combination! The country of bold and
enterprising merchants, of shrewd manufacturers, of
far-seeing men of business, and of cunning artificers;
the country, too, of such fearless thinkers as George
Buchanan, David Hume, and Adam Smith, is awed by
a few noisy and ignorant preachers, to whom it allows
a license, and yields a submission, disgraceful to the age,
and incompatible with the commonest notions of liberty.
A people, in many respects very advanced, and holding
upon political subjects enlightened views, do, upon all
religious subjects, display a littleness of mind, an illiberality
of sentiment, a heat of temper, and a love of
persecuting others, which shows that the Protestantism
of which they boast has done them no good; that, in the
most important matters, it has left them as narrow as it
found them; and that it has been unable to free them
from prejudices which make them the laughing-stock
of Europe, and which have turned the very name of
the Scotch Kirk into a by-word and a reproach among
educated men.</p>

<p>I shall now endeavour to explain how all this arose,
and how such apparent inconsistencies are to be reconciled.
That they may be reconciled, and that the inconsistencies
are merely apparent and not real, will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
at once admitted by whoever is capable of a scientific
conception of history. For, in the moral world, as in
the physical world, nothing is anomalous; nothing is
unnatural; nothing is strange. All is order, symmetry,
and law. There are opposites, but there are no contradictions.
In the character of a nation, inconsistency is
impossible. Such, however, is still the backward condition
of the human mind, and with so evil and jaundiced
an eye do we approach the greatest problems, that not
only common writers, but even men from whom better
things might be hoped, are on this point involved in
constant confusion, perplexing themselves and their
readers by speaking of inconsistency, as if it were a
quality belonging to the subject which they investigate,
instead of being, as it really is, a measure of their own
ignorance. It is the business of the historian to remove
this ignorance, by showing that the movements of nations
are perfectly regular, and that, like all other movements,
they are solely determined by their antecedents. If he
cannot do this, he is no historian. He may be an annalist,
or a biographer, or a chronicler, but higher than
that he cannot rise, unless he is imbued with that spirit
of science which teaches, as an article of faith, the doctrine
of uniform sequence; in other words, the doctrine
that certain events having already happened, certain
other events corresponding to them will also happen.
To seize this idea with firmness, and to apply it on all
occasions, without listening to any exceptions, is extremely
difficult, but it must be done by whoever wishes
to elevate the study of history from its present crude
and informal state, and do what he may towards placing
it in its proper rank, as the head and chief of all the
sciences. Even then, he cannot perform his task unless
his materials are ample, and derived from sources of
unquestioned credibility. But if his facts are sufficiently
numerous; if they are very diversified; if they have
been collected from such various quarters that they can
check and confront each other, so as to do away with
all suspicion of their testimony being garbled; and if he
who uses them possesses that faculty of generalization,
without which nothing great can be achieved, he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
hardly fail in bringing some part of his labours to a
prosperous issue, provided he devotes all his strength to
that one enterprise, postponing to it every other object
of ambition, and sacrificing to it many interests which
men hold dear. Some of the most pleasurable incentives
to action, he must disregard. Not for him, are those
rewards which, in other pursuits, the same energy would
have earned; not for him, the sweets of popular applause;
not for him, the luxury of power; not for him,
a share in the councils of his country; not for him, a
conspicuous and honoured place before the public eye.
Albeit conscious of what he could do, he may not compete
in the great contest; he cannot hope to win the
prize; he cannot even enjoy the excitement of the struggle.
To him, the arena is closed. His recompense lies
within himself, and he must learn to care little for the
sympathy of his fellow-creatures, or for such honours as
they are able to bestow. So far from looking for these
things, he should rather be prepared for that obloquy
which always awaits those, who, by opening up new veins
of thought, disturb the prejudices of their contemporaries.
While ignorance, and worse than ignorance, is
imputed to him, while his motives are misrepresented,
and his integrity impeached, while he is accused of
denying the value of moral principles, and of attacking
the foundation of all religion, as if he were some public
enemy, who made it his business to corrupt society, and
whose delight it was to see what evil he could do; while
these charges are brought forward, and repeated from
mouth to mouth, he must be capable of pursuing in
silence the even tenor of his way, without swerving,
without pausing, and without stepping from his path to
notice the angry outcries which he cannot but hear, and
which he is more than human if he does not long to
rebuke. These are the qualities, and these the high resolves,
indispensable to him, who, on the most important
of all subjects, believing that the old road is worn out
and useless, seeks to strike out a new one for himself,
and, in the effort, not only perhaps exhausts his strength,
but is sure to incur the enmity of those who are bent
on maintaining the ancient scheme unimpaired. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
solve the great problem of affairs; to detect those hidden
circumstances which determine the march and destiny
of nations; and to find, in the events of the past, a key
to the proceedings of the future, is nothing less than to
unite into a single science all the laws of the moral and
physical world. Whoever does this, will build up afresh
the fabric of our knowledge, re-arrange its various parts,
and harmonize its apparent discrepancies. Perchance,
the human mind is hardly ready for so vast an enterprise.
At all events, he who undertakes it will meet
with little sympathy, and will find few to help him.
And let him toil as he may, the sun and noontide of his
life shall pass by, the evening of his days shall overtake
him, and he himself have to quit the scene, leaving that
unfinished which he had vainly hoped to complete. He
may lay the foundation; it will be for his successors to
raise the edifice. Their hands will give the last touch;
they will reap the glory; their names will be remembered
when he is forgotten. It is, indeed, too true, that
such a work requires, not only several minds, but also
the successive experience of several generations. Once,
I own, I thought otherwise. Once, when I first caught
sight of the whole field of knowledge, and seemed,
however dimly, to discern its various parts and the
relation they bore to each other, I was so entranced with
its surpassing beauty, that the judgment was beguiled,
and I deemed myself able, not only to cover the surface,
but also to master the details. Little did I know how
the horizon enlarges as well as recedes, and how vainly
we grasp at the fleeting forms, which melt away and
elude us in the distance. Of all that I had hoped to do,
I now find but too surely how small a part I shall accomplish.
In those early aspirations, there was much that
was fanciful; perhaps there was much that was foolish.
Perhaps, too, they contained a moral defect, and savoured
of an arrogance which belongs to a strength that refuses
to recognize its own weakness. Still, even now
that they are defeated and brought to nought, I cannot
repent having indulged in them, but, on the contrary, I
would willingly recall them, if I could. For, such hopes
belong to that joyous and sanguine period of life, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
alone we are really happy; when the emotions are more
active than the judgment; when experience has not yet
hardened our nature; when the affections are not yet
blighted and nipped to the core; and when the bitterness
of disappointment not having yet been felt, difficulties
are unheeded, obstacles are unseen, ambition is a pleasure
instead of a pang, and the blood coursing swiftly through
the veins, the pulse beats high, while the heart throbs
at the prospect of the future. Those are glorious days;
but they go from us, and nothing can compensate their
absence. To me, they now seem more like the visions
of a disordered fancy, than the sober realities of things
that were, and are not. It is painful to make this confession;
but I owe it to the reader, because I would not
have him to suppose that either in this, or in the future
volumes of my History, I shall be able to redeem my
pledge, and to perform all that I promised. Something,
I hope to achieve, which will interest the thinkers of
this age; and something, perhaps, on which posterity
may build. It will, however, only be a fragment of my
original design. In the two last chapters I have attempted,
and in the two next chapters I shall still further
attempt, to solve a curious problem in the history of
Scotland, which is intimately connected with other problems
of a yet graver import: but though the solution
will, I believe, be complete, the evidence of the solution
will, most assuredly, be imperfect. I regret to add, that
such imperfection is henceforth an essential part of my
plan. It is essential, because I despair of supplying
those deficiencies in my knowledge, of which I grow
more sensible in proportion as my views become more
extensive. It is also essential, because, after a fair estimate
of my own strength, of the probable duration of
my life, and of the limits to which industry can safely
be pushed, I have been driven to the conclusion, that
this Introduction, which I had projected as a solid foundation
on which the history of England might subsequently
be raised, must either be greatly curtailed, and
consequently shorn of its force, or that, if not curtailed,
there will hardly be a chance of my being able to narrate,
with the amplitude and fulness of detail which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
richly deserve, the deeds of that great and splendid
nation with which I am best acquainted, and of which
it is my pride to count myself a member. It is with
the free, the noble, and the high-minded English people,
that my sympathies are most closely connected; on them
my affections naturally centre; from their literature,
and from their example, my best lessons have been
learnt; and it is now the most cherished and the most
sacred desire of my heart, that I may succeed in writing
their history, and in unfolding the successive phases of
their mighty career, while I am yet somewhat equal to the
task, and before my faculties have begun to dwindle, or
the power of continuous attention has begun to decay.</p>

faint idea of his real feelings. It is perhaps hardly necessary to

will, however, find, in the <i>Clarendon State Papers</i> (vol. ii. p. 260
Oxford, 1773, folio), a letter from Charles I., which is worth looking
at, because it frankly avows that James, in loving episcopacy and hating
presbyterianism, was actuated rather by political motives than by
religious ones. Charles writes: &lsquo;The prudentiall part of any
consideration will never be found opposit to the conscientious, nay
heere, they go hand in hand; for (according to lawyers lodgique) show me
any president where ever Presbiteriall government and Regall was
together, without perpetuall rebellions. <i>Which was the cause that
necessitated the King, my Father, to change that governement in
Scotland.</i>&rsquo; Compare what is said by a Scotch Presbyterian of the
seventeenth century, in <i>Biographies edited for the Wodrow Society</i> by
the Rev. W. K. Tweedie, Edinburgh, 1845, vol. i. p. 13. &lsquo;The reason why
King James was so violent for bishops was neither their divine
institution (which he denied they had), nor yet the profit the Church
should reap by them (for he knew well both the men and their
communications), but merely because he believed they were useful
instruments to turn a limited monarchy into absolute dominion, and
subjects into slaves, the design in the world he minded most.&rsquo;</p></div>

of this part of Scotch history is the subject of angry controversy, and

of Montrose, in 1600. I subjoin a few extracts from the enactments
of that Assembly, in order that the reader may judge for himself, and
may test the accuracy of what I have stated in the text. &lsquo;Concerning the
maner of choosing of him that sall have vote in Parliament in name of

choose ane, of quhom he best lykes; and his Majestie promises, obleises,
and binds himselfe to choose no vther but ane of that number: And in
cace his Majestie refuses the haill vpon ane just reason of ane
insufficiency, and of greater sufficiencie of vthers that are not

General Assemblies of the Kirk of Scotland</i>, vol. iii. p. 954. &lsquo;As to
the cautions to keip him, that sall have vote in Parliament, from
corruptiouns: They be these following: 1. <i>That he presume
not, at any tyme, to propone at Parliament, Counsell or Conventioun, in
name of the Kirk, any thing without expresse warrand and directioun from
the Kirk</i>, and sick things as he sall answer (for) to be for the weill
of the Kirk, vnder the paine of depositioun from his office.&rsquo; &hellip; 2. &lsquo;He sall

<i>Pitcairn's Criminal Trials</i>, vol. ii. p. 504. In connexion with these
transactions, a letter is preserved in the Winwood Papers, which is much
too curious to be passed over in silence. It is addressed by the Earl of
Salisbury to Sir Charles Cornwallis, and is dated 12th September 1605.
Salisbury, who was then at the head of affairs, writes, &lsquo;True it is that
his Majestie seeking to <i>adorne that kingdome of Scotland with Prelates
as they are in England</i>, some of the Ministers have spurned against it;
and althouge his Majestie had ever warranted their calling of General
Assemblies upon no other condition, then that they should make him
acquainted, receive his warrant, and a commissioner for his Majestie
resident in their councells, yet have they (followed with some poor
plebecall numbers) presumed to hold their General Assemblies in some
parte of the Realme contrarie to his commandement. Whereupon his
Majestie hath shewed himself displeased, and cyted divers of them before
his councell,&rsquo; &amp;c. <i>Memorials of Affairs of State, from the Papers of
Sir Ralph Winwood</i>, London, 1725, folio, vol. ii. p. 132. And yet the
man who could write such nonsense as this, and who could only see, in
the great democratic movement of the Scotch mind, a disinclination to
the <i>adornment</i> of episcopacy, was deemed one of the most eminent
statesmen of his time, and his reputation has survived him. If great
statesmen discern so little of what is before them and around them, we
are tempted to inquire, how much confidence ought to be placed in the
opinions of those average statesmen by whom countries are ruled. For my
own part, I can only say, that I have had occasion to read many thousand
letters written by diplomatists and politicians, and I have hardly ever
found an instance of one of them who understood the spirit and tendency
of the age in which he lived.</p></div>

remarks, p. 62: &lsquo;This commissioun and executioun thereof, as it exalted
the aspyring bishops farre above any prelat that ever was in Scotland,
so it putt the king in possessioun of that which he had long tyme hunted
for; to witt, of the royall prerogative, and absolute power to use the
bodeis and goods of the subjects at pleasure, without forme or processe
of the commoun law, even then when the Lower Hous in England was

were fitt instruments to overthrow the liberteis both of the Kirk and

Galloway, who died in 1619, and of whom Calderwood says (<i>History of the

his two covetous counsellours, Andro Couper, his brother, and Johne
Grilmour, wrytter in Edinburgh, for his use and theirs, by racting of

But though the king was capable of fear, he was incapable of
compunction. There is no evidence on record, to show that he even felt
remorse for having planned and executed those arbitrary and unprincipled
measures, by which he inflicted immense misery upon Scotland and
England, but more especially upon Scotland.</p></div>

misrepresent this transaction by looking at it from an English point of
view, I will merely quote what Scotch writers have said respecting it.
&lsquo;Giveing up the king to the will and pleasure of the English parliament,
that soe they might come by ther money.&rsquo; <i>Somerville's Memorie of the
Somervilles</i>, vol. ii. p. 366. &lsquo;The Scots sold their unfortunate king,
who had fled to them for protection, to the commissioners of the English
Parliament, for 200,000<i>l.</i> sterling.&rsquo; <i>Lyon's History of
St. Andrews</i>, vol. ii. p. 38. &lsquo;The incident itself was evidence of a
bargain with a <i>quid pro quo</i>.&rsquo; <i>Burton's History of Scotland</i>, vol. i.
p. 493. &lsquo;The sale of the king to the parliament.&rsquo; <i>Napier's Life of
Montrose</i>, Edinburgh, 1840, p. 448. &lsquo;The king was delivered up, or
rather sold, to the parliament's commissioners.&rsquo; <i>Brown's History of
Glasgow</i>, vol. i. p. 91. &lsquo;Their arrears were undoubtedly due; the amount
was ascertained before the dispute concerning the disposal of his
person, and the payment was undertaken by the English parliament, five
months previous to the delivery, or surrender of the king. But the
coincidence, however unavoidable, between that event and the actual
discharge and departure of their army, still affords a presumptive proof
of the disgraceful imputation of having sold their king; &ldquo;as the
English, unless previously assured of receiving his person, would never
have relinquished a sum so considerable as to weaken themselves, while
it strengthened a people with whom such a material question remained to
be discussed.&rdquo;&rsquo; <i>Laing's History of Scotland</i>, vol. iii. pp. 369, 370.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_325_325" id="Footnote_325_325"></a><a href="#FNanchor_325_325"><span class="label">[325]</span></a> A letter from Sir Edw. Hyde to Lord Hatton, dated April
12, 1649 (in the <i>Clarendon State Papers</i>, vol. ii. p. 479, Oxf. 1773,
fol.), says of Charles II., that the Scotch &lsquo;sold his father to those
who murdered him.&rsquo; But this is not true. Charles I., though certainly
bought by the English, was not murdered by them. He was tried in the
face of day; he was found guilty; he was executed. And most assuredly
never did a year pass, without men far less criminal than he, suffering
the same fate. Possibly, they are right who deem all capital punishment
needless. That, however, has never been proved; and if this last and
most terrible penalty is ever to be exacted, I cannot tell where we
should find a more fitting subject to undergo it, than a despot who
seeks to subjugate the liberties of the people over whom he is called to
rule, inflicts cruel and illegal punishment on those who oppose him,
and, sooner than renounce his designs, engages in a civil war, setting
fathers against their children, disorganizing society, and causing the
land to run with blood. Such men are outlaws; they are the enemies of
the human race; who shall wonder if they fall, or, having fallen, who
shall pity them?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_326_326" id="Footnote_326_326"></a><a href="#FNanchor_326_326"><span class="label">[326]</span></a> The declaration was signed by Charles on the 16th August
1650. An abridgment of it is given in <i>Balfour's Annales of Scotland</i>,
vol. iv. pp. 92&ndash;94; but the entire document is preserved by Sir Edward
Walker. See <i>Journal of Affairs in Scotland</i>, in <i>Walker's Historical
Discourses</i>, London, folio, 1705, pp. 170&ndash;176. In it Charles is made to
state that, &lsquo;though his Majesty as a dutiful son be obliged to honour
the memory of his Royal Father, and have in estimation the person of his
Mother; yet doth he desire to be deeply humbled and afflicted in spirit
before God, because of his Father's hearkening unto and following evil
councils, and his opposition to the work of reformation, and to the
solemn league and covenant by which so much of the blood of the Lord's
people hath been shed in these kingdoms.&rsquo; He went on to say, that though
he might palliate his own misconduct by pleading &lsquo;his education and
age,&rsquo; he thinks it better to &lsquo;ingeniously acknowledge all his own sins
and the sins of his father's house.&rsquo; Burnet (<i>History of his own Time</i>,
vol. i. p. 97) says of this declaration: &lsquo;In it there were many hard
things. The king owned the sin of his father in marrying into an
idolatrous family: he acknowledged the bloodshed in the late wars lay at
his father's door: he expressed a deep sense of his own ill education,&rsquo;

Council, besides other evidence now lost, says, that the period from
1660 to 1688 was &lsquo;a very horrid scene of oppression, hardships, and
cruelty, which, were it not incontestably true, and well vouched and
supported, could not be credited in after ages.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's History of
the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution</i>, vol. i.
p. 57. And the Reverend Alexander Shields, quaintly, but truly,
observes, &lsquo;that the said Government was the most untender, unpeaceable,
tyrannical, arbitrary and wicked, that ever was in Scotland in any age
or period.&rsquo; <i>Shields' Scots Inquisition</i>, Edinburgh, 1745, p. 24.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_329_329" id="Footnote_329_329"></a><a href="#FNanchor_329_329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a> When James I. ascended the throne of England, &lsquo;the
principal native nobility&rsquo; accompanied him; and &lsquo;the very peace which
ensued upon the union of the crowns, may be considered as the
commencement of an era in which many of our national strongholds were
either transformed into simple residences or utterly deserted.&rsquo;
<i>Irving's History of Dumbartonshire</i>, 4to, 1860, pp. 137, 166. The
nobles &lsquo;had no further occasion to make a figure in war, their power in
vassalage was of little use, and their influence of course decayed. They
knew little of the arts of peace, and had no disposition to cultivate
them.&rsquo; <i>The Interest of Scotland Considered</i>, Edinburgh, 1733, p. 85.
Under Charles I., the movement continued; &lsquo;which fell out, partly
through the giddiness of the times, but more by the way his Majesty had
taken at the beginning of his reign; at which time he did recover from
divers of them their hereditary offices, and also pressed them to quit
their tithes (which formerly had kept the gentry in a dependance upon
them), whereby they were so weaken'd that now when he stood most in need
of them (except the chief of the clans) they could command none but
their vassals.&rsquo; <i>Guthry's Memoirs</i>, edit. 1702, pp. 127, 128. Then came
the civil wars, and the rule of Cromwell, during which they suffered
both in person and in property. Compare <i>Chambers' Annals</i>, vol. ii. p.
225, with <i>Laing's History of Scotland</i>, vol. iii. pp. 515, 516. In
1654, Baillie writes (<i>Letters and Journals</i>, vol. iii. p. 249): &lsquo;Our
nobilitie, weell near all, are wracked.&rsquo; In 1656, &lsquo;Our nobles lying up
in prisons, and under forfaultries, or debts, private or publict, are
for the most part either broken or breaking.&rsquo; <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 317. And, in
1658, the same observer writes (vol. iii. p. 387): &lsquo;Our noble families
are almost gone: Lennox hes little in Scotland unsold; Hamilton's
estate, except Arran and the Baronrie of Hamilton, is sold; Argyle can
pay little annuelrent for seven or eight hundred thousand merks; and he
is no more drowned in debt than publict hatred, almost of all, both
Scottish and English; the Gordons are gone; the Douglasses little
better; Eglintoun and Glencairn on the brink of breaking; many of our
chief families estates are cracking; nor is there any appearance of any
human relief for the tyme.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The result of all this is thus described by Wodrow, under the year 1661:
&lsquo;Our nobility and gentry were remarkably changed to the worst: it was
but few of such, who had been active in the former years, were now
alive, and those few were marked out for ruin. A young generation had
sprung up under the English government, educated under penury and
oppression; their estates were under burden, and many of them had little
other prospect of mending their fortunes, but by the king's favour, and
so were ready to act that part he was best pleased with.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's
History of the Church of Scotland</i>, vol. i. p. 89.</p></div>

of the royal prerogative in Scotland; and the nobles, whose estates were
wasted, or their spirit broken, by the calamities to which they have
been exposed, were less able and less willing than ever to resist the
power of the crown. During his reign, and that of James VII., the
dictates of the monarch were received in Scotland with most abject
submission. The poverty to which many of the nobles were reduced,
rendered them meaner slaves and more intolerable tyrants than ever. The
people, always neglected, were now odious, and loaded with every injury,
on account of their attachment to religious and political principles,
extremely repugnant to those adopted by their princes.&rsquo; <i>Robertson's
History of Scotland</i>, book viii. pp. 257, 258.</p></div>

episcopacy was in the autumn of 1661, as we learn from an entry in

ecclesiastical commission was procured by Sharp.&rsquo; See also p. 41: &lsquo;Under
the influence of Sharp and the prelates, which Lauderdale's friends were
unable to resist, the government seemed to be actuated by a blind
resentment against its own subjects.&rsquo; Compare <i>Burnet's History of his
own Time</i>, vol. i. p. 365. &lsquo;The truth is, the whole face of the
government looked liker the proceedings of an inquisition than of legal
courts; and yet Sharp was never satisfied.&rsquo; Another contemporary,
Kirkton, says of these Commissioners: &lsquo;For ought I could hear, never one
appeared before them that escapt without punishment. Their custom was
without premonition or lybell, to ask a man a question, and judge him
presently, either upon his silence or his answer.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;They many times
doubled the legal punishment; and not being satisfied with the fyne
appointed by law, they used to add religation to some remote places, or
deportation to Barbadoes, or selling into slavery.&rsquo; <i>Kirkton's History
of the Church of Scotland</i>, p. 206. See also <i>Naphtali, or the
Wrestlings of the Church of Scotland</i>, 1667, pp. 126&ndash;130. But as
particular cases bring such matters more clearly before the mind, I will
transcribe, from <i>Crookshank's History of the Church of Scotland</i>, vol.
i. p. 154, the sentences pronounced on a single occasion by this
episcopal court. &lsquo;The treatment of some of the parishioners of Ancrum is
not to be omitted. When their excellent minister, Mr. Livingstone, was
taken from them, one Mr. James Scot, who was under the sentence of
excommunication, was presented to that charge. On the day fixed for his
settlement, several people did meet together to oppose it; and
particularly a country woman, desiring to speak with him in order to
dissuade him from intruding himself upon a reclaiming people, pulled him
by the cloak, intreating him to hear her a little; whereupon he turned
and beat her with his staff. This provoked two or three boys to throw a
few stones, which neither touched him nor any of his company. However,
it was presently looked upon as a treasonable tumult, and therefore the
sheriff and justices of the peace in that bounds fined and imprisoned
some of these people, which, one would think, might atone for a crime of
this nature. But the high-commission, not thinking that sufficient,
ordered those criminals to be brought before them. Accordingly, the four
boys and this woman, with two brothers of hers of the name of Turnbull,
were brought prisoners to Edinburgh. The four boys confessed, that, upon
Scot's beating the woman, they had thrown each his stone. The
commissioner told them that hanging was too good for them. However, the
sentence of this merciless court only was, that they should be scourged
through the city of Edinburgh, burnt in the face with a hot iron, and
then sold as slaves to Barbadoes. The boys endured their punishment like
men and Christians, to the admiration of multitudes. The two brothers
were banished to Virginia; and the woman was ordered to be whipped
through the town of Jedburgh. Burnet, bishop of Glasgow, when applied to
that she might be spared lest she should be with child, mildly answered,
That he would make them claw the itch out of her shoulders.&rsquo;</p></div>

&lsquo;It is no wonder then the complaint against their bishops be, that their

401.</p>

<p>Sir James Turner, whose Memoirs, written by himself, were not published
till thirty years ago, relates an anecdote of his own drunkenness in a
strain of maudlin piety well worthy of his career. <i>Turner's Memoirs of
his own Life</i>, Edinburgh, 1829, 4to, pp. 42, 43. At p. 206, this
impudent man writes: &lsquo;And yet I confesse, my humour never was, nor is
not yet, one of the calmest; when it will be, God onlie knoues; yet by
many sad passages of my life, I know that <i>it hath beene good for me to
be afflicted</i>.&rsquo; Perhaps, however, he may take the benefit of his
assertion (p. 144), &lsquo;that I was so farre from exceeding or transgressing
my commission and instructions, that I never came the full length of
them.&rsquo; Considering the cruelties he committed, what sort of instructions
could his superiors have given to him?</p></div>

master, compared with General Dalziel, his ruffians, and Sir William
Bannatyne, this year.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's Church of Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 62.
Dalziel &lsquo;cruelly tortured whom he would.&rsquo; p. 63. One woman &lsquo;is brought
prisoner to Kilmarnock, where she was sentenced to be let down to a deep
pit, under the house of the dean, full of toads and other vile
creatures. Her shrieks thence were heard at a great distance.&rsquo; p. 64.
Two countrymen were &lsquo;bound together with cords, and hanged up by their
thumbs to a tree, there to hang all night.&rsquo; <i>Ibid.</i> Sir William
Bannatyne's soldiers seized a woman, &lsquo;and bound her, and put lighted
matches betwixt her fingers for several hours; the torture and pain made
her almost distracted; she lost one of her hands, and in a few days she
died.&rsquo; <i>Ibid.</i> &lsquo;Oppressions, murders, robberies, rapes.&rsquo; p. 65. &lsquo;He made

work, but contains many facts with which Wodrow was unacquainted. See
<i>Crookshank</i>, vol. i. p. 11. Respecting the outrages in 1667, there are
some horrible details in a book published in that very year, under the
title of <i>Naphtali, or the Wrestlings of the Church of Scotland</i>. See,
especially, the summary at p. 174: &lsquo;wounding, beating, stripping and
imprisoning mens persons, violent breaking of their houses both by day

deflowring of women, forcing wives and other persons by fired matches
and other tortures to discover their husbands and nearest relations,

implements of torture. &lsquo;They had good store of iron shackles, as if they
were to lead back vast numbers of slaves, and thumb-locks, as they call
them&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> thumb-screws), &lsquo;to make their examinations and trials
with.&rsquo; vol. ii. p. 389. &lsquo;In some places they tortured people, by
scorching their bodies at vast fires, and other wise,&rsquo; vol. ii. p. 422.
Compare <i>Laing's History of Scotland</i>, vol. iv. p. 88. &lsquo;Neither age nor
sex was exempt from outrage, and torture was freely employed to extort a
confession of hidden wealth.&rsquo; And, at p. 91, &lsquo;The Highlanders, after
exacting free quarters, and wasting the country for three months, were
dismissed to their hills with impunity and wealth.&rsquo;</p></div>

bloodshed from this year&rsquo; (1661), &lsquo;until the revolution, was either

to by a writer of that time, the Rev. Alexander Shields, who calls
James, not a man, but a monster. See <i>Shields' Hind let loose</i>, 1687, p.
365. &lsquo;This man, or monster rather, that is now mounted the throne.&rsquo; And
a monster surely he was. Compare <i>Crookshank's History of the Church of
Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 66, where it is mentioned that, when Spreul was
tortured, &lsquo;the Duke of York was pleased to gratify his eyes with this
delightful scene.&rsquo; Also, <i>Wodrow's History</i>, vol. iii. p. 253, and
<i>Laing's History of Scotland</i>, vol. iv. p. 116. &lsquo;According to Burnet, the
duke's pleasure at witnessing human agony was a cold, and, as it were, a
speculative pleasure, as if he were present for the purpose of
contemplating some curious experiment. But James was so excitable a man,
that this is hardly likely. At all events, the remarks of Burnet have a
painful interest for those who study these dark, and, as we may rejoice
to think, these very rare, forms of human malignity.&rsquo; &lsquo;When any are to
be struck in the boots, it is done in the presence of the council; and
upon that occasion, almost all offer to run away. The sight is so
dreadful, that without an order restraining such a number to stay, the
board would be forsaken. But the duke, while he had been in Scotland,
was so far from withdrawing, that he looked on all the while with an
unmoved indifference, and <i>with an attention, as if he had been to look
on some curious experiment</i>. This gave a terrible idea of him to all
that observed it, as of a man that had no bowels nor humanity in him.&rsquo;

communing, the king's smith was called in, to bring in a new instrument
to torture by the thumbkins, that had never been used before. For
whereas the former was only to screw on two pieces of iron above and
below with finger and thumb, these were made to turn about the screw
with the whole hand. And under this torture, I continued near an hour
and a half.&rsquo; See also the case of Spence, in the same year, in <i>Burnet's
History of his own Time</i>, vol. ii. p. 418. &lsquo;Little screws of steel were
made use of, that screwed the thumbs with so exquisite a torment, that
he sunk under this; for Lord Perth told him, they would screw every
joint of his whole body, one after another, till he took the oath.&rsquo;

gentlemen in Nithsdale and Annandale, and, I suppose, in most other
shires of the kingdom, but I name those as being the scene of the
severities now used, were summoned to attend the king's standard; and
the militia in the several shires were raised. Wherever Claverhouse
came, he resolved upon narrow and universal work. He used to set his
horse upon the hills and eminences, and that in different parties, that
none might escape; and there his foot went through the lower, marshy,
and mossy places, where the horse could not do so well. The shire he
parcelled out in so many divisions, and six or eight miles square would
be taken in at once. In every division, the whole inhabitants, men and
women, young and old, without distinction, were all driven into one
convenient place.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;All the children in the division were gathered
together by themselves, under ten years, and above six years of age, and
a party of soldiers were drawn out before them. Then they were bid pray,
for they were going to be shot. Some of them would answer, Sir, we
cannot pray.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;At other times, they treated them most inhumanly,
threatening them with death, and at some little distance would fire
pistols without ball in their face. Some of the poor children were
frighted almost out of their wits, and others of them stood all out with
a courage perfectly above their age. These accounts are so far out of

always a part of war. In this, they were very apt. Burnet (<i>History of

robbing;&rsquo; and Burton (<i>Lives of Lovat and Forbes</i>, p. 47) says, &lsquo;To
steal even vestments was considerably more creditable than to make
them.&rsquo; Otherwise, they were completely absorbed by their passion for
war. See <i>Thomson's Memoirs of the Jacobites</i>, vol. ii. pp. 175, 176,

qualities of individuals, the appearance of the Pretender in 1715
disgusted them, notwithstanding his splendid lineage. See some excellent
remarks in <i>Burton's History of Scotland</i>, from 1689 to 1748, London,
1853, vol. ii. pp. 198, 199. At p. 383, Mr. Burton justly observes, that
&lsquo;those who really knew the Highlanders were aware that the followers
were no more innate supporters of King James's claim to the throne of
Britain, than of Maria Theresa's to the throne of Hungary. They went
with the policy of the head of the clan, whatever that might be; and
though upwards of half a century's advocacy of the exiled house&rsquo; (this
refers to the last rebellion in 1745) &lsquo;had made Jacobitism appear a
political creed in some clans, it was among the followers, high and low,
little better than a nomenclature, which might be changed with
circumstances.&rsquo; Since Robertson, Mr. Burton and Mr. Chambers are, I will
venture to say, the two writers who have taken the most accurate and
comprehensive views of the history of Scotland. Robertson's History
stops short where the most important period begins; and his materials
were scanty. But what he effected with those materials was wonderful. To
my mind, his History of Scotland is much the greatest of his
works.</p></div>

<i>Anderson's Prize Essay on the Highlands</i>, Edinburgh, 1827, p. 128.
&lsquo;Cattle were the main resources of the tribe&mdash;the acquisition of these
the great object of their hostile forrays. The precarious crops gave
them wherewithal to bake their oaten cakes, or distil their ale or
whisky. When these failed, the crowded population suffered every extreme
of misery and want. At one time in particular, in Sutherland, they were
compelled to subsist on broth made of nettles, thickened with a little
oatmeal. At another, those who had cattle, to have recourse to the
expedient of bleeding them, and mixing the blood with oatmeal, which
they afterwards cut into slices and fried.&rsquo;</p></div>

made, amounted to somewhat more than 9000 men, the greatest number that
Charles ever had under his command,&rsquo; p. 164. But the actual invaders of
England were much fewer. &lsquo;The number of the rebels when they began their
march into England was a few above 5000 foot, with about 500 on
horseback.&rsquo; <i>Home</i>, p. 331. Browne (<i>History of the Highlands</i>, vol.

amounted only to about 4500 men;&rsquo; and Lord George Murray states that, at
Derby, &lsquo;we were not above five thousand fighting men, if so many.&rsquo;
<i>Jacobite Memoirs of the Rebellion of 1745</i>, edited by Robert Chambers,

evidence, says, &lsquo;Charles, at the head of 4000 Highlanders, marched as
far as Derby.&rsquo; <i>Brown's History of Glasgow</i>, vol. ii. p. 41, Edinburgh,
1797. Compare <i>Johnstone's Memoirs of the Rebellion</i>, 3rd edit., London,

Patullo, our muster-master, reviewed our army at Carlisle, when it did

Carlisle, and recall the detachment sent forward to Dumfries. The
Highlanders, still true to their stagnant principles, refused
obedience.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Pecuniary negotiations were now commenced, and they were
offered sixpence a day of regular pay&mdash;reasonable remuneration at that
period to ordinary troops, but to the wild children of the mountain a
glittering bribe, which the most steady obstinacy would alone resist. It
was partly effective.&rsquo; <i>Burton's History of Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 168.
&lsquo;And from this day, the Highlanders had sixpence a head per day payed
them to keep them in good order and under command.&rsquo; <i>Patten's History of
the late Rebellion</i>, London, 1717, p. 73. See also, on the unwillingness
of the Highlanders to enter England, <i>Rae's History of the Rebellion</i>,
London, 1746, 2d edit. pp. 270, 271. Browne says (<i>History of the
Highlands</i>, vol. ii. pp. 300, 304): &lsquo;The aversion of the Highlanders,
from different considerations, to a campaign in England, was almost
insuperable;&rsquo; but &lsquo;by the aid of great promises and money, the greater
part of the Highlanders were prevailed upon to follow the fortunes of
their commander.&rsquo;</p></div>

scarcely two hundred of the infantry escaped.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The Highlanders
obtained a glorious booty in arms and clothes, besides self-moving
watches, and other products of civilisation, which surprised and puzzled
them. Excited by such acquisitions, a considerable number could not
resist the old practice of their people to return to their glens, and
decorate their huts with their spoil.&rsquo; <i>Burton's History of Scotland</i>,
vol. ii. p. 465. Compare <i>Home's History of the Rebellion</i>, p. 123. This
was an old practice of theirs, as Montrose found out, a century earlier,
&lsquo;when many of the Highlanders, being loaded with spoil, deserted
privately, and soon after returned to their own country.&rsquo; <i>Wishart's
Memoirs of the Marquis of Montrose</i>, Edinburgh, 1819, p. 189. So, too,
Burnet (<i>Memoirs of the Dukes of Hamilton</i>, p. 272): &lsquo;Besides, any
companies could be brought down from the Highlands might do well enough
for a while, but no order could be expected from them, for as soon as
they were loaded with plunder and spoil, they would run away home to
their lurking holes, and desert those who had trusted them.&rsquo; See also p.
354. A more recent writer, drawing a veil over this little infirmity,
remarks, with much delicacy, that &lsquo;the Highlanders, brave as they were,
had a custom of returning home after a battle.&rsquo; <i>Thomson's Memoirs of
the Jacobites</i>, London, 1845, vol. i. p. 122. Not unfrequently they
first robbed their fellow-soldiers. In 1746, Bisset writes: &lsquo;The
Highlanders, who went off after the battel, carried off horses and
baggage from their own men, the Lowlanders.&rsquo; <i>Diary of the Reverend John
Bisset</i>, in <i>Miscellany of the Spalding Club</i>, vol. i. p. 377, Aberdeen,

fixed government, was sure of the aid of the chiefs, because a settled
government was ruinous to their power, and almost inimical to their
existence. The more it cultivated the arts of peace, and throve on
industrially created well-being, the more did it drive into an
antagonist position a people who did not change their nature, who made
no industrial progress, and who lived by the swords which acquired for
them the fruits of other men's industry. With their interests, a
peaceful, strong government was as inconsistent as a well-guarded
sheepfold with the interest of wolves.&rsquo; <i>Burton's History of Scotland</i>,

their character between the rebellion of 1715 and that of 1745, writes,
&lsquo;The ordinary Highlanders esteem it the most sublime degree of virtue to
love their chief, and pay him a blind obedience, although it be in
opposition to the government, the laws of the kingdom, or even to the
law of God. He is their idol; and as <i>they profess to know no king but
him</i> (I was going farther), so will they say, they ought to do whatever
he commands, without inquiry.&rsquo; <i>Letters from a Gentleman in the North of
Scotland</i>, edit. London, 1815, vol. ii. pp. 83, 84. &lsquo;The Highlanders in
Scotland are, of all men in the world, the soonest wrought upon to
follow their leaders or chiefs into the field, having a wonderful
veneration for their Lords and Chieftains, as they are called there:
<i>Nor do these people ever consider the validity of the engaging cause</i>,
but blindly follow their chiefs into what mischief they please, and that
with the greatest precipitation imaginable.&rsquo; <i>Patten's History of the
Rebellion</i>, London, 1717, p. 151. &lsquo;The power of the chiefs over their
clans was the true source of the two rebellions. The clansmen cared no
more about the legitimate race of the Stuarts, than they did about the
war of the Spanish succession.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The Jacobite Highland chiefs ranged
their followers on the Jacobite side&mdash;the Hanoverians ranged theirs on
the side of government. Lovat's conduct was a sort of <i>experimentum
crucis</i>; he made his clan Hanoverian in one rebellion, and Jacobite in
another.&rsquo; <i>Burton's Lives of Lovat and Forbes</i>, p. 150. Compare the
change of side of the Mackintoshes, in <i>Browne's History of the
Highlands</i>, vol. ii. p. 285. Even so late as the American war, the
sovereign was deemed subordinate to the chief. &lsquo;One Captain Frazer from
the northern district, brought down a hundred of his clan, all of the
name of Frazer. Few of them could understand a word of English; and the
only distinct idea they had of all the mustering of forces which they
saw around them, was that they were going to fight for King Frazer and
George ta Three.&rsquo; <i>Penny's Traditions of Perth</i>, pp. 49, 50, Perth,
1836.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_364_364" id="Footnote_364_364"></a><a href="#FNanchor_364_364"><span class="label">[364]</span></a> Which gave rise to a report that they were cannibals. &lsquo;The
late Mr. Halkston of Rathillet, who had been in this expedition&rsquo; (the
Rebellion of 1745), &lsquo;told Mr. Young that the belief was general among
the people of England, that the Highlanders ate children.&rsquo; <i>Johnstone's
Memoirs of the Rebellion</i>, 3rd edit. London, 1822, p. 101. Such a
rumour, notwithstanding its absurdity, was made somewhat plausible by
the revolting conduct of the Highlanders in the first rebellion of 1715,
when they committed, in the Lowlands, horrible outrages on corpses which
they dug up. See the contemporary evidence, in <i>Correspondence of the

mangled their dead bodies&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;till the stench put them away.&rsquo; In 1745,
they signalized their entrance into England in the following manner.
&lsquo;The rebels, during their stay in Carlisle, committed the most shocking
detestable villanies; for, not contented with robbing families of their
most valuable effects, they scrupled not to act their brutal insolence
on the persons of some young ladies, even in the presence of their
parents. A gentleman, in a letter to his friend in London, writes thus:
&ldquo;That, after being in a manner stripped of every thing, he had the
misery to see three of his daughters treated in such a manner that he
could not relate it.&rdquo;&rsquo; <i>Marchant's History of the present Rebellion</i>,

of their own party despaired of success. See the Jacobitical account in
<i>The Lockhart Papers</i>, London, 4to, 1817, vol. ii. p. 458:
&lsquo;The next thing to be considered of, was what was now to be done;
they were now at Derby, with an army not half the number of what they
were reported to be, surrounded in a manner with regular troops on all
sides, and more than double their number. To go forward, there was no
encouragement, for their friends (if they had any) had kept little or no
correspondence with them from the time they entered England.&rsquo; The
Chevalier de Johnstone, who took an active part in the Rebellion,
frankly says, &lsquo;If we had continued to advance to London, and had
encountered all the troops of England, with the Hessians and Swiss in
its pay, there was every appearance of our being immediately
exterminated, without the chance of a single man escaping.&rsquo; <i>Johnstone's
Memoirs of the Rebellion in 1745 and 1746</i>, p. 79.</p></div>

unwilling to advance far south of Carlisle, &lsquo;without more encouragement
from the country than we had hitherto got.&rsquo; See his own account, in <i>The
Jacobite Memoirs of the Rebellion of 1745</i>, edited by R. Chambers,
Edinburgh, 1834, p. 48. But his prudent advice was overruled. The
Highlanders pressed on; and that happened, which any one, tolerably
acquainted with England, might have foreseen. Johnstone (<i>Memoirs of the
Rebellion</i>, p. 70) says, &lsquo;In case of a defeat in England, no one in our
army could by any possibility escape destruction, as the <i>English
peasants were hostile towards us in the highest degree</i>; and, besides,
the army of Marshal Wade was in our rear, to cut us off from all
communication with Scotland.&rsquo; And at p. 81, &lsquo;In every place we passed
through, we found the English very ill disposed towards us, except at
Manchester, where there appeared some remains of attachment to the house
of Stuart.&rsquo; The champion of arbitrary power would find a different
reception now, in that magnificent specimen of English prosperity, and
of true, open-mouthed, English fearlessness. But a century ago, the men
of Manchester were poor and ignorant; and the statement of Johnstone
respecting them is confirmed by Home, who says, &lsquo;At Manchester, several
gentlemen, and about 200 or 300 of the common people, joined the rebel
army; <i>these were the only Englishmen (a few individuals excepted) who
joined Charles in his march through the country of England</i>.&rsquo; <i>Home's
History of the Rebellion in 1745</i>, London, 1802, 4to, p. 145.
In 1715, the English equally held back, except at Manchester. See

Pennant, who visited Scotland in 1769, says, &lsquo;These publick works were
at first very disagreeable to the old chieftains, and lessened their
influence greatly: for by admitting strangers among them, their clans
were taught that the Lairds were not the first of men.&rsquo; <i>Pennant's Tour
in Scotland</i>, 4th edit. Dublin, 1775, vol. i. p. 204. Towards the end of
the eighteenth century, this feeling began to die away. &lsquo;Till of late,
the people of Kintail, as well as other Highlands, had a strong aversion
to roads. The more inaccessible, the more secure, was their maxim.&rsquo;

settlement, the ardent feelings of the Scottish people were turned out
of their old channels of religious controversy and war in the direction
of commercial enterprise.&rsquo; <i>Burton's Criminal Trials in Scotland</i>, vol.
i. p. 104. Compare <i>Burnet's History of his own Time</i>, vol. iv. pp. 286,
287, 418; and the note (at p. 419): &lsquo;The lords and commons of Scotland
were then desirous of getting into trade.&rsquo; This is under the year 1699.
In 1698, Fletcher of Saltoun writes: &lsquo;by no contrivance of any man, but
by an unforeseen and unexpected change of the genius of this nation, all
their thoughts and inclinations, as if united and directed by a higher
power, seemed to be turned upon trade, and to conspire together for its
advancement.&rsquo; <i>First Discourse on the Affairs of Scotland</i>, in <i>Fletcher
of Saltoun's Political Works</i>, Glasgow, 1749, p. 57. At this, the clergy
were uneasy. In 1709, the Reverend Robert Wodrow expresses an opinion,
in one of his letters, that &lsquo;the sin of our too great fondness for
trade, to the neglecting of our more valuable interests, I humbly think
will be written upon our judgment.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's Correspondence</i>,
Edinburgh, 1842, 8vo, vol. i. p. 67. In the same year, some ships being
taken by the French, part of the loss fell upon Glasgow. Thereupon,
Wodrow writes: &lsquo;It's said that in all there is about eighty thousand
pound sterling lost there, whereof Glasgow has lost ten thousand pound.
I wish trading persons may see the language of such a Providence. I am
sure the Lord is remarkably frouning upon our trade, in more respects
than one, since it was put in the room of religion, in the late
alteration of our constitution.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's Analecta</i>, vol. i. p. 218,

genius of the nation had acquired a new direction; and as the press is
the true criterion of the spirit of the times, the numerous productions
on political and commercial subjects, with which it daily teemed, had
supplanted the religious disputes of the former age.&rsquo; Unfortunately for
Scotland, they were by no means supplanted. Still, the movement was
great, and not to be mistaken.</p></div>

in 1706, &lsquo;the commons in the Scottish parliament were 160; the peers
145.&rsquo; Of these peers, the Treaty of Union declared that &lsquo;sixteen shall
be the number to sit and vote in the House of Lords.&rsquo; <i>De Foe's History
of the Union between England and Scotland</i>, London, 1786, 4to, pp. 205,

impossible to mistake the result of this sweeping measure, by which, as
was said at the time, &lsquo;Scotland was to retrench her nobility.&rsquo; <i>De Foe's
History of the Union</i>, p. 495. Compare p. 471: &lsquo;The nobility being
thereby, as it were, degraded of their characters.&rsquo; In 1710, a Scotchman
writes in his journal: &lsquo;It was one of the melancholyest sights to any
that have any sense of our antient Nobility, to see them going throu for
votes, and making partys, and giving their votes to others who once had
their oun vote; and I suspect many of them reu the bargain they made, in
giving their oun pouer away.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's Analecta</i>, vol. i. p. 308.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_373_373" id="Footnote_373_373"></a><a href="#FNanchor_373_373"><span class="label">[373]</span></a> The Scotch, consequently, became so eager to do away with
this source of mirth, that even as late as the year 1761, when the
notorious lecturer, Sheridan, visited Edinburgh, &lsquo;such was the rage for
speaking with an English accent, that more than three hundred gentlemen,
among whom were the most eminent in the country for rank and learning,
attended him.&rsquo; <i>Ritchie's Life of Hume</i>, London, 1807, p. 94. It was,
however, during about twenty years immediately after the Union, that the
Scotch members of Parliament, both Lords and Commons, were most jeered
at in London, and were treated with marked disrespect, socially and
politically. Not only were they mocked and lampooned, but they were also
made tools of. In September 1711, Wodrow writes (<i>Analecta</i>, vol. i. p.
348, 4to, 1842): &lsquo;In the beginning of this (month), I hear a generall
dissatisfaction our Nobility, that wer at last Parliament, have at their
treatment at London. They complean they are only made use of as tools
among the English, and cast by when their party designes are over.&rsquo; The
next year (1712), the Scotch members of the House of Commons met
together, and expressed their &lsquo;high resentment of the uncivil, haughty
treatment they mett with from the English.&rsquo; <i>The Lockhart Papers</i>,
London, 1817, 4to, vol. i. p. 417. See, further, <i>Burton's History of
Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 27. &lsquo;Without descending to rudeness, the polished
contemporaries of Wharton and St. John could madden the sensitive and
haughty Scots by light shafts of raillery, about their pronunciation or
knowledge of parliamentary etiquette.&rsquo; Some curious observations upon
the way in which the Scotch pronounced English, late in the seventeenth
century, will be found in <i>Morer's Short Account of Scotland</i>, London,
1702, pp. 13, 14. The author of this book was chaplain to a Scotch

abound, the following is by no means the worst. Burnet, as a Scotchman,
thinks proper to say that those of his countrymen who were sent to
parliament, &lsquo;were persons of such distinction, that they very well
deserved&rsquo; the respect and esteem with which they were treated. To which,
Lord Dartmouth adds: &lsquo;and were very importunate to have their deserts
rewarded. A Scotch earl pressed Lord Godolphin extremely for a place. He
said there was none vacant. The other said, his lordship could soon make
one so, if he pleased. Lord Godolphin asked him, if he expected to have
any body killed to make room? He said, No; but Lord Dartmouth commonly
voted against the court, and every body wondered that he had not been
turned out before now. Lord Godolphin told him, he hoped his lordship
did not expect that he should be the person to propose it; and advised
him never to mention it any more, for fear the queen should come to hear
of it; for if she did, his lordship would run great risk never to have a
place as long as she lived. But he could not forbear telling every
where, how ill the lord treasurer had used him.&rsquo; <i>Burnet's History of
his own Time</i>, vol. v. p. 349, Oxford, 1823. Compare the account, in
1710, in <i>Wodrow's Analecta</i>, vol. i. p. 293. &lsquo;Argyle is both picked
(<i>i.e.</i> piqued) at Marlburrou, and his brother Yla, for refusing him a
regiment; and Godolphin should have said to the queen that my Lord Yla
was not to be trusted with a regiment! The Earl of Marr was one of the
greatest cronnies Godolphine had, till the matter of his pension, after
the Secretary office was taken from him, came about. Godolphine caused
draw it during pleasure; Marr expected it during life, which the
Treasurer would not yield to, and therefore they brake.&rsquo; The history of
the time is full of these wretched squabbles, which show what the Scotch
nobles were made of. Indeed, their rapacity was so shameless, that, in
1711, several of them refused to perform their legislative duties in
London, unless they received some offices which they expected. &lsquo;About
the midle of this moneth, I hear ther was a meeting of severall of our
Scots Peers, at the Viscount of Kilsyth's, where they concerted not to
goe up to this parliament till peremptorly writ for; and (also) some
assurance be given of the places they were made to hope for last session
and have missed.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's Analecta</i>, vol. i. p. 365. In 1712, the same
Scotchman writes (<i>Analecta</i>, vol. ii. p. 8): &lsquo;Our Scots Peers' secession
from the House of Peers makes much noise; but they doe not hold by it.
They sometimes come and sometimes goe, and <i>they render themselves base
in the eyes of the English</i>.&rsquo; See also a letter &lsquo;concerning the Scots

quality to England:&rsquo; and a letter to him, in 1716, describes the
Anglicizing process going on among the Scotch aristocracy, only nine
years after the Union. &lsquo;Most of our Lords and others here do so much

1859, p. 57), notices that, owing to &lsquo;transfers of property and
extinction of old families in the Highlands, as well as from more
general causes,&rsquo; the old clannish affection &lsquo;is passing away.&rsquo; But this
intelligent observer has not indicated the connexion between so
important a fact and the Rebellion of 1745. In 1792, Heron writes: &lsquo;The
prejudices of clanship have almost died away.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The dependents of
the family of Kenmure are still attached to its representative with much
of that affection and respect with which the tribes of the Highlands
have <i>till lately</i> been accustomed to adhere to their lord.&rsquo; <i>Heron's

same year, in <i>Lettice's Letters on a Tour through various parts of
Scotland</i>, London, 1794, p. 340. To trace the movement back still
further, Pennant writes, in 1769: &lsquo;But in many parts of the Highlands,
their character begins to be more faintly marked; they mix more with the
world; and <i>become daily less attached to their chiefs</i>.&rsquo; &hellip;
&lsquo;During the feudal reign, their love for their
chieftain induced them to bear many things, at <i>present intolerable</i>.&rsquo;
These two important passages are in the 4th edition of <i>Pennant's Tour
in Scotland</i>, vol. i. p. 194, vol. ii. p. 307, Dublin, 1775. They prove
that, twenty-four years after the Rebellion of 1745, the decay of
affection was so manifest, as to strike a candid and careful, but by no
means philosophic, observer. For Pennant to have discerned these
changes, they must already have risen to the surface. Other and
corroborative evidence will be found in <i>Sinclair's Account of
Scotland</i>, vol. ii. p. 545, Edinburgh, 1792; and vol. iii. pp. 377, 437,

Greenock to make a contract with the superior, by which they agreed to
an assessment of 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> sterling on every sack of malt, brewed into
ale, within the limits of the town; the money so levied to be applied in
liquidating the expence of forming a proper harbour at Greenock. The
work was begun at the epoch of the Union, in 1707; and a capacious
harbour, containing upwards of ten Scottish acres, was formed by
building an extensive circular pier, with a straight pier, or tongue, in
the middle, by which the harbour was divided into two parts. This
formidable work, the greatest of the kind, at that time, in Scotland,
incurred an expence of more than 100,000 marks Scots.&rsquo; <i>Chalmers'

it is stated, that &lsquo;the inhabitants took the matter (1707) into their
own hands, and agreed with their superior to assess themselves at a
certain rate, to build a proper pier and harbour. The work was finished
in 1710, at an expence of 5,555<i>l.</i>&rsquo;</p></div>

merchants of the city; they thereby obtained the liberty of a free
commerce to America and the West Indies, from which they had been before
shut out; they chartered English vessels for these voyages, having none
at first fit for the purpose; sent out cargoes of goods for the use of
the colonies, and returned home laden with tobacco. The business doing
well, vessels were built belonging to the city, and in the year 1718,
the first ship, the property of Glasgow, crossed the Atlantic.&rsquo;
<i>Denholm's History of Glasgow</i>, p. 405, 3rd edit. Glasgow, 1804. Brown
(<i>History of Glasgow</i>, vol. ii. p. 330, Edinburgh, 1797) says, that the
Glasgow merchants &lsquo;chartered Whitehaven ships for many years:&rsquo; but that,
&lsquo;in 1716, a vessel of sixty tons burden was launched at Crawford's dike,
being the first Clyde ship that went to the British Settlements in
America with goods and a supercargo.&rsquo; But this date is probably two
years too early. Mr. M'Culloch, in his excellent <i>Geographical and
Statistical Dictionary</i>, London, 1849, vol. ii. p. 659, says: &lsquo;But for a
while, the merchants of Glasgow, who first embarked in the trade to
America, carried it on by means of vessels belonging to English ports;
and it was not till 1718 that a ship built in Scotland (in the Clyde),
the property of Scotch owners, sailed for the American colonies.&rsquo;
Gibson, also (<i>History of Glasgow</i>, 1777, p. 206), says: &lsquo;In 1718, the

tobacco and sugar; an advantage this kingdom never enjoyed till the
Union. They are purchasing a harbour on the Frith, near Alloway, to

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">AN EXAMINATION OF THE SCOTCH INTELLECT DURING THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</div>

<p>The remaining part of this volume, I purpose to devote
to an attempt to unravel still further that two-fold
paradox, which forms the prominent peculiarity of the
history of Scotland. The paradox consists, as we have
seen, in the fact, first, that the same people have long
been liberal in politics, and illiberal in religion; and,
secondly, that the brilliant, inquisitive, and sceptical
literature which they produced in the eighteenth century,
was unable to weaken their superstition, or to instil
into them wiser and larger maxims on religious matters.
From an early period, there were, as I have endeavoured
to show, many circumstances which predisposed the
Scotch to superstition, and, so far, had a general connexion
with the subject before us. But the remarkable
phenomenon with which we are immediately concerned,
may, I think, be traced to two distinct causes. The first
cause was, that, for a hundred and twenty years after
the establishment of Protestantism, the rulers of Scotland
either neglected the Church or persecuted it,
thereby driving the clergy into the arms of the people,
from whom alone they could obtain sympathy and
support. Hence an alliance between the two parties,
more intimate than would otherwise have been possible;
and hence, too, the rise of that democratic spirit which
was the necessary consequence of such an union, and
which the clergy encouraged, because they were opposed
and thwarted by the upper classes. So far, the result
was extremely beneficial, as it produced a love of independence
and a hatred of tyranny, which, twice
during the seventeenth century, saved the country from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the yoke of a cruel despotism. But these very circumstances,
which guarded the people against political
despotism, exposed them all the more to ecclesiastical
despotism. For, having no one to trust except their
preachers, they trusted them entirely and upon all
subjects. The clergy gradually became supreme, not
only in spiritual matters, but also in temporal ones.
Late in the sixteenth century, they had been glad to
take refuge among the people; before the middle of the
seventeenth century, they ruled the people. How
shamefully they abused their power, and how, by encouraging
the worst kind of superstition, they prolonged
the reign of ignorance, and stopped the march of
society, will be related in the course of this chapter;
but, in fairness to them, we ought to acknowledge, that
the religious servitude into which the Scotch fell during
the seventeenth century, was, on the whole, a willing
one, and that, mischievous as it was, it had at least a
noble origin, inasmuch as the influence of the Protestant
clergy is mainly to be ascribed to the fearlessness
with which they came forward as leaders of the
people, at a period when that post was full of danger,
and when the upper classes were ready to unite with
the crown in destroying the last vestiges of national
liberty.</p>

<p>To trace the operation of this cause of Scotch superstition,
will be the business of the present chapter;
while, in the next and concluding chapter, I shall
examine the other cause, which I have as yet hardly
mentioned. This latter inquiry will involve some considerations
respecting the philosophy of method, still
imperfectly appreciated among us, and on which the
history of the Scotch mind will throw considerable
light. For, it will appear, that, during the eighteenth
century, the ablest Scotchmen, with hardly an exception,
adopted a method of investigating truth, which
cut them off from the sympathies of their countrymen,
and prevented their works from producing the effect
which they might otherwise have done. The result
was, that though a very sceptical literature was produced,
scepticism made no progress, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
superstition was undiminished. The highly-educated
minds, indeed, were affected; but they formed a class
apart, and there were no means of communication
between them and the people. That this was owing to
the method which literary men employed, I hope to
prove in the next chapter; and if I succeed in doing so,
it will be evident, that I have been guilty of no exaggeration
in terming this the second great cause of the
prolongation of Scotch superstition, since it was sufficiently
powerful to prevent the intellectual classes from
exercising their natural functions as the disturbers of
old opinions.</p>

<p>We have already seen, that almost immediately after
the Reformation, ill-feeling arose between the upper
classes and the spiritual leaders of the Protestant church,
and that this ill-feeling increased until, in 1580, it vented
itself by the abolition of episcopacy. This bold and
decisive measure made the breach irreparable. The
preachers had now committed themselves too far to recede,
even if they had desired to do so; and from that
moment, uniting themselves heartily with the people,
they took up a position which they have never since
abandoned. During the remaining twenty-three years
that James was in Scotland, they were occupied in
exciting the people against their rulers; and as they
became more democratic, so did the crown and nobles
grow more hostile, and display, for the first time, a disposition
to combine together in defence of their common
interests. In 1603, James ascended the throne of England,
and the struggle began in earnest. It lasted, with
few interruptions, eighty-five years, and, during its
continuance, the Presbyterian clergy never wavered;
they were always steady to the good cause; always on
the side of the people. This greatly increased their
influence; and what favoured it still more was, that,
besides being the champions of popular liberty, they
were also the champions of national independence. When
James I. and the two Charles's attempted to force episcopacy
upon Scotland, the Scotch rejected it, not only
because they hated the institution, but also because they
looked on it as the mark of a foreign domination, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
they were determined to resist. Their nearest and
most dangerous enemy was England; and they spurned
the idea of receiving bishops who must, in the first
instance, be consecrated in London, and who, it was
certain, would never have been admitted into Scotland
unless England had been the stronger country. It was,
therefore, on patriotic, as well as religious, grounds, that
the Scotch clergy, during the seventeenth century,
struggled against episcopacy;<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and when they overthrew
it, in 1638, their bold and determined conduct
associated, in the popular mind, the love of country with
the love of the church. Subsequent events strengthened
this association.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> In 1650, Cromwell invaded Scotland,
overthrew the Scotch in the battle of Dunbar, and intrusted
to Monk the task of curbing their spirit, by
building fortresses, and establishing a long chain of
military posts.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The nation, cowed and broken, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
way, and, for the first time for three centuries, felt the
pressure of a foreign yoke. The clergy alone remained
firm.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Cromwell, who knew that they were the chief
obstacle to completing his conquest, hated them, and
did every thing he could to ruin them.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> But their
power was too deeply seated to be shaken. From their
pulpits, they continued to influence and animate the
people. In face of the invaders, and in spite of them,
the Scotch church continued to hold its General Assemblies,
until the summer of 1653. Then, indeed, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
had to yield to brute force; and the people, to their
unutterable grief, beheld the venerated representatives
of the Scotch kirk driven from their place of meeting
by English soldiers, and led like criminals through the
streets of Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was that in Scotland, after the latter part of
the sixteenth century, every thing tended to increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the reputation of the clergy, by raising them to the
foremost rank among the defenders of their country.
And it was but natural that the spiritual classes, finding
themselves in the ascendant, should conduct the contest
according to views habitual to their profession, and
should be anxious for religious advantages, rather than
for temporal benefits. The war which the Scotch
waged against Charles I. partook more of the character
of a crusade than any war ever carried on by a Protestant
nation.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> The main object was, to raise up presbyters,
and to destroy bishops. Prelacy was the
accursed thing, and that must be rooted out at every
hazard. To this, all other considerations were subordinate.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
The Scotch loved liberty, and hated England.
Yet, even these two passions, notwithstanding their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
strength, were as nothing, in comparison with their
intense desire to extend and to propagate, if need be at
the point of the sword, their own Presbyterian polity.
This was their first and paramount duty. They fought,
indeed, for freedom, but, above all, they fought for
religion. In their eyes, Charles was the idolatrous head
of an idolatrous church, and that church they were
resolved to destroy. They felt that their cause was
holy, and they went forth full of confidence, convinced
that the sword of Gideon was drawn on their side, and
that their enemies would be delivered up to them.</p>

<p>The rebellion, therefore, against Charles, which, on
the part of the English, was essentially secular,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> was,
on the part of the Scotch, essentially religious. This
was because with us, the laymen were stronger than the
clergy; while with them, the clergy were stronger than
the laymen. In 1643, both nations having united
against the king, it was thought advisable that an
intimate alliance should be concluded; but, in the
negotiations which followed, it is noticed, by a contemporary
observer, that though the English merely wished
for a civil league, the Scotch demanded a religious
covenant.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> And as they would only continue the war
on condition that this was granted, the English were
obliged to give way. The result was the Solemn League
and Covenant, by which what seemed a cordial union
was effected between the two countries.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Such a
compact was, however, sure to be short-lived, as each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
party had different objects; the aim of the English
being political, while that of the Scotch was religious.
The consequences of this difference were soon apparent.
In January 1645, negotiations having been opened with
the king, commissioners met at Uxbridge, with the
view of concluding a peace. The attempt failed, as
might have been expected, seeing that, not only were
the pretensions of the king irreconcilable with those of
his opponents, but that the pretensions of his opponents
were irreconcilable with each other. At Uxbridge,
during the conferences, the Scotch expressed their
readiness to concede to him what he required, if he
would gratify them in regard to the Church; while the
English, occupying themselves with civil and political
questions, cared less, says Clarendon, for what concerned
the Church than for anything else.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> A better illustration
could hardly be found of the secular character
of the English rebellion, as compared with the spiritual
character of the Scotch rebellion. Indeed, the Scotch,
so far from concealing this, boasted of it, and evidently
thought that it proved how superior they were to their
worldly-minded neighbours. In February 1645, the
General Assembly issued an address to the nation, including
not only those who were at home, but also those
who served in armies out of Scotland. In this document,
which, proceeding from such a quarter, necessarily
exercised great influence, political considerations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
as having to do merely with the temporal happiness
of men, are treated as insignificant, and almost despicable.
That Rupert was defeated, and that York
and Newcastle were taken, were but trifling matters.
They were only the means of accomplishing an end,
and that end was the reformation of religion in England,
and the establishment there of the pure Presbyterian
polity.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>A war, undertaken with such holy objects, and conceived
in so elevated a spirit, was supposed to be placed
under the immediate protection of the Deity, on whose
behalf it was carried on. In the language of the time,
it was a war for God, and for God's church. Every
victory that was obtained, was the result, not of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
skill of the general, nor of the valour of the troops, but
was an answer to prayer.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> When a battle was lost, it
was either because God was vexed at the sins of the
people,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> or else to show them that they must not trust
to the arms of the flesh.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> Nothing was natural; all
was supernatural. The entire course of affairs was
governed, not by their own antecedents, but by a series
of miracles. To assist the Scotch, winds were changed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and storms were lulled. Such intelligence as was
important for them to receive, was often brought by
sea; and, on those occasions, it was expected that, if
the wind were unfavourable, Providence would interfere,
would shift it from one quarter to another, and, when
the news had safely arrived, would allow it to return to
its former direction.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>It was in this way that, in Scotland, every thing
conspired to strengthen that religious element which
the force of circumstances had, at an early period, made
prominent, and which now threatened to absorb all the
other elements of the national character. The clergy
were supreme; and habits of mind natural and becoming
to themselves, were diffused among all classes.
The theories of a single profession outweighed those of
all other professions; and not only war, but also trade,
literature, science, and art, were held of no account
unless they ministered to the general feeling. A state
of society so narrow and so one-sided, has never been
seen in any other country equally civilized. Nor did
there appear much chance of abating this strange monopoly.
As the seventeenth century advanced, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
train of events was continued; the clergy and the
people always making common cause against the crown,
and being, by the necessity of self-preservation, forced
into the most intimate union with each other. Of this,
the preachers availed themselves to strengthen their
own influence; and for upwards of a century their
exertions stopped all intellectual culture, discouraged all
independent inquiry, made men in religious matters
fearful and austere, and coloured the whole national
character with that dark hue, which, though now
gradually softening, it still retains.</p>

<p>The Scotch, during the seventeenth century, instead
of cultivating the arts of life, improving their minds, or
adding to their wealth, passed the greater part of their
time in what were called religious exercises. The sermons
were so long and so frequent, that they absorbed
all leisure, and yet the people were never weary of
hearing them. When a preacher was once in the pulpit,
the only limit to his loquacity was his strength. Being
sure of a patient and reverential audience, he went on
as long as he could. If he discoursed for two hours
without intermission, he was valued as a zealous pastor,
who had the good of his flock at heart; and this was
about as much as an ordinary clergyman could perform,
because, in uttering his sentiments, he was expected to
display great vehemence, and to evince his earnestness
by toiling and sweating abundantly.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> This boundary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
was, however, often passed by those who were equal to
the labour; and Forbes, who was vigorous as well as
voluble, thought nothing of preaching for five or six
hours.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> But, in the ordinary course of nature, such
feats were rare; and, as the people were in these matters
extremely eager, an ingenious contrivance was hit upon
whereby their desires might be satisfied. On great occasions,
several clergymen were present in the same
church, in order that, when one was fatigued, he might
leave the pulpit, and be succeeded by another, who, in
his turn, was followed by a third; the patience of the
hearers being apparently inexhaustible.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Indeed, the
Scotch, by the middle of the seventeenth century, had
grown accustomed to look up to their minister as if he
were a god, and to dwell with rapture upon every word
that dropt from his lips. To hear a favourite preacher,
they would incur any fatigue, and would undertake
long journeys without sleep or food.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Their power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
attention was marvellous. The same congregation would
sometimes remain together for ten hours, listening to
sermons and prayers, interspersed with singings and
readings.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> In an account of Scotland in 1670, it is
stated that, in a single church in Edinburgh, thirty
sermons were delivered every week.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Nor is this at all
unlikely, considering the religious enthusiasm of the
age. For, in those times, the people delighted in the
most harassing and ascetic devotions. Thus, for instance,
in 1653, when the sacrament was administered,
they pursued the following course. On Wednesday,
they fasted, and listened to prayers and sermons for
more than eight hours. On Saturday they heard two
or three sermons; and on Sunday, the number of sermons
was so great that they stayed in church more than
twelve hours; while, to conclude the whole, three or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
four additional ones were preached on Monday by way
of thanksgiving.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>Such eagerness, and yet such patience, indicate a
state of society altogether peculiar, and for which we
find no parallel in the history of any civilized country.
This intense desire to hear whatever the preachers had
to say, was, in itself, a homage of the most flattering
kind, and was naturally accompanied by a belief that
they were endowed with a light which was withheld from
their less gifted countrymen. It is not surprising that
the clergy, who, at no period, and in no nation, have
been remarkable for their meekness, or for a want of
confidence in themselves, should, under circumstances
so eminently favourable to their pretensions, have been
somewhat elated, and should have claimed an authority
even greater than that which was conceded to them.
And as this is intimately connected with the subsequent
history of Scotland, it will be necessary to collect some
evidence respecting their conduct, which will have the
further advantage of exhibiting the true character of
spiritual domination, and of showing how it works, not
only on the intellectual, but also on the practical, life of
a people.</p>

<p>According to the Presbyterian polity, which reached
its height in the seventeenth century, the clergyman of
the parish selected a certain number of laymen on whom
he could depend, and who, under the name of elders,
were his councillors, or rather the ministers of his authority.
They, when assembled together, formed what
was called the Kirk-Session, and this little court, which
enforced the decisions uttered in the pulpit, was so supported
by the superstitious reverence of the people, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
it was far more powerful than any civil tribunal. By
its aid, the minister became supreme. For, whoever
presumed to disobey him was excommunicated, was deprived
of his property, and was believed to have incurred
the penalty of eternal perdition.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Against such weapons,
in such a state of society, resistance was impossible.
The clergy interfered with every man's private concerns,
ordered how he should govern his family, and often
took upon themselves the personal control of his household.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
Their minions, the elders, were everywhere;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for each parish was divided into several quarters, and
to each quarter one of these officials was allotted, in
order that he might take special notice of what was
done in his own district.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Besides this, spies were appointed,
so that nothing could escape their supervision.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Not only the streets, but even private houses, were
searched, and ransacked, to see if any one was absent
from church while the minister was preaching.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> To
him, all must listen, and him all must obey. Without
the consent of his tribunal, no person might engage
himself, either as a domestic servant, or as a field
labourer.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> If any one incurred the displeasure of
the clergy, they did not scruple to summon his servants
and force them to state whatever they knew
respecting him, and whatever they had seen done in
his house.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> To speak disrespectfully of a preacher
was a grievous offence;<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> to differ from him was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
heresy;<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> even to pass him in the streets without saluting
him, was punished as a crime.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> His very name
was regarded as sacred, and not to be taken in vain.
And that it might be properly protected, and held in
due honour, an Assembly of the Church, in 1642, forbad
it to be used in any public paper unless the consent
of the holy man had been previously obtained.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>These and similar proceedings, being upheld by public
opinion, were completely successful. Indeed, they
could hardly have been otherwise, seeing that it was
generally believed that whoever gainsaid the clergy,
would be visited, not only with temporal penalties, but
also with spiritual ones. For such a crime, there was
punishment here, and there was punishment hereafter.
The preachers willingly fostered a delusion by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
they benefited. They told their hearers, that what was
spoken in the pulpit was binding upon all believers, and
was to be regarded as immediately proceeding from the
Deity.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> This proposition being established, other propositions
naturally followed. The clergy believed that
they alone were privy to the counsels of the Almighty,
and that, by virtue of this knowledge, they could determine
what any man's future state would be.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Going
still further, they claimed the power, not only of foretelling
his future state, but also of controlling it; and
they did not scruple to affirm that, by their censures,
they could open and shut the kingdom of heaven.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
if this were not enough, they also gave out that a word
of theirs could hasten the moment of death, and by cutting
off the sinner in his prime, could bring him at once
before the judgment-seat of God.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>Utterly horrible as such a pretension now appears, it
was made, not only with impunity, but with advantage;
and numerous instances are recorded, in which the people
believed that it was strictly enforced. The celebrated
John Welsh, sitting one night at table, round which a
party were assembled at supper, began to discourse to
the company respecting the state of their souls. Those
who were present listened with humility; but to this
general feeling there was one exception. For, it so happened
that a Roman Catholic was in the room, and he,
of course, disagreed with the opinions expressed by the
Presbyterian divine. If he had been a cautious man,
he would have kept his disagreement to himself; but
being a hot-headed youth, and being impatient at seeing
a single person engross the conversation, he lost
his temper, and not only ridiculed Welsh, but actually
made faces at him. Thereupon, Welsh charged the
company to take heed, and see what the Lord was
about to do to him who mocked. Scarcely had this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
threat been uttered, when it was carried into execution.
He who had dared to jest at the minister, suddenly fell,
sank under the table, and died there in presence of the
whole party.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>This happened early in the seventeenth century, and
being bruited abroad, it became a great terror to all
evil-doers. But, after a time, its effect appears to have
been weakened; since another man was equally rash
some forty or fifty years afterwards. It seems that a
Scotch clergyman of considerable repute, Mr. Thomas
Hog, was, like Welsh, sitting at supper, when it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
chanced that the servants forgot to lay the knives.
Mr. Hog, thinking the opportunity a favourable one,
observed that such forgetfulness was of little moment,
and that, while we thought so much of our comforts
here, it was far more necessary to consider our condition
hereafter. A gentleman present, amused, either
by the manner of Mr. Hog, or by the skill with
which he introduced the topics of his own profession,
was unable to restrain himself, and burst out into a
violent fit of laughter. The minister, however, was not
to be checked, and he continued after such a fashion,
that the laughter was repeated louder than ever. At
length Mr. Hog turned round, and told his merry
comrade that very shortly he should seek for mercy, but
find it not. That same night, the scoffer was taken ill,
and in great alarm sent for Mr. Hog. It was, however,
useless. Before the clergyman could reach his room,
the sinner was lying dead, a lost and ruined man.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was it merely in private houses that such examples
were made. Sometimes the clergyman denounced
the offender from the pulpit, and the punishment was
as public as the offence. It is said that Gabriel Semple,
when preaching, had a strange habit of putting out his
tongue, and that this excited the mirth of a drunken
man, who went into the church, and, by way of derision,
put out his tongue also. But, to his horror, he found
that, though he could put it out, he could not draw it
in again. The result was, that the tongue stiffened; it
lost all sensibility; and, paralysis coming on, the man
died a few days after his transgression.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Occasionally, the penalty was less severe, though the
miracle was equally conspicuous. In 1682, a certain
woman took upon herself to scold the famous divine,
Peden, who was justly regarded as one of the great
lights of the Scotch Church. &lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
eminent man, &lsquo;I wonder your tongue is not sore with
so much idle clatter.&rsquo; She indignantly replied, that
she had never suffered, either from a sore tongue, or
from a sore mouth. He told her that she soon would.
And the consequence of his saying so was, that her
tongue and gums swelled to that degree, that for some
days she was unable to take her usual food.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>She escaped with her life; others were more sharply
handled. A clergyman was interrupted in the midst of
his sermon by three gentlemen leaving the church. It
is not stated that there was any thing offensive in their
manner; but their object in going was to amuse themselves
at some fair or race, and the minister, no doubt,
thought that they should have been content with the
gratification of hearing him. At all events, he was dissatisfied,
and, after the sermon was over, he censured
their conduct, and threatened them with the divine displeasure.
His words were remembered, and, to the awe
of his parishioners, every tittle was fulfilled. Of the
three gentlemen, all died violent deaths; one of them
broke his neck by falling from his horse, and another
was found in his room with his throat cut.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Cases of this sort were frequent during the seventeenth
century; and as in that credulous age they were
firmly believed and widely circulated, the power of the
clergy was consolidated by them. The Laird of Hilton
once ventured to pull a minister out of a pulpit which
was not his own, and into which he had unlawfully intruded.
&lsquo;For the injury you have done to the servant
of God,&rsquo; cried the enraged preacher, &lsquo;you shall be
brought into this church like a sticked sow.&rsquo; And so
indeed he was. Yet a little while, and Hilton became
entangled in a quarrel, was run through the body, and
his corpse, still bleeding, was carried into the very
church where the outrage had been committed.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Even when a clergyman was in prison, he retained
the same power. His authority was delegated to him
from on high, and no temporal misfortune could curtail
it. In 1673, the Reverend Alexander Peden, when in
confinement, heard a young girl laughing at him outside
the door of his room, while he was engaged in those
vociferous devotions for which he was celebrated. The
mirth of the poor child cost her dear. Peden denounced
against her the judgment of God. In consequence of
that denunciation, the wind blew her from a rock on
which she was walking, and swept her into the sea,
where she was quickly drowned.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the vengeance of the clergy extended to
the innocent offspring of the man who had offended
them. A certain minister, whose name has not been
preserved, met with opposition in his parish, and fell
into pecuniary and other difficulties. He applied for
aid to a trader, who, being wealthy, ought, he thought,
to afford him assistance. The trader, however, thought
otherwise, and refused. Upon this, the clergyman declared
that God would visit him. The result was, that
his business not only declined, but his mind became
impaired, and he died an idiot. He had two sons and
two daughters. Both his sons went mad. One of his
daughters, likewise, lost her reason. The other daughter
being married, even her husband became destitute, and
the children of that marriage became beggars, that the
heinous crime might be visited to the third generation.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>To prosecute a minister, or even to assert one's rights
against him before a civil tribunal, was not only a hazard,
but a certain ruin. About the year 1665, James Fraser
was sued in a court of law for a large sum of money, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to be due from his father's estate. As usually happens
in these cases, the party sued, considered that he was
unjustly treated, and that his opponent had no right to
make the claim. So far, all was natural. But the peculiarity
was, that Fraser, against whom the action was
brought, was a young man preparing for the ministry,
and, therefore, under the immediate protection of Providence.
Such an one was not to be vexed with impunity;
and we are assured by Fraser himself that God specially
interposed to prevent his ruin; that one of his opponents
was made unable to appear in court, and that the
Lord, laying his hand upon the others, put them to
death, in order that every obstacle might be at once
removed.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>While stories of this sort were generally believed, it
was but natural that an opinion should grow up that it
was dangerous to meddle with a minister, or in any way
to interfere with his conduct.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The clergy, intoxicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
by the possession of power, reached to such a pitch of
arrogance, that they did not scruple to declare, that
whoever respected Christ, was bound, on that very account,
to respect them.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> They denounced the judgments
of God upon all who refused to hear the opinions they
propounded in their pulpits.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Nor did this apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
merely to persons who usually formed their audience.
Such was their conceit, and so greedy were they after
applause, that they would not allow even a stranger to
remain in their parish, unless he, too, came to listen to
what they chose to say.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Because they had adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the Presbyterian polity, they asserted that the Almighty
had never failed to punish every one who tried to supersede
it;<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> and as this was the perfection of the church,
those who were blind to its merits, were given over to
wrath, and were, indeed, the slaves of Satan.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> The
clergy, who held this language respecting their opponents,
exhausted the choicest epithets of praise on themselves,
and on their own pursuits. When one of them
got into the pulpit, or took a pen in his hand, he
seemed as if he could not find words strong enough to
express his sense of the surpassing importance of that
class of which he was himself a member.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> They alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
knew the truth; they alone were able to inform and enlighten
mankind. They had their instruction direct from
heaven; they were, in fact, the ambassadors of Christ;
from him they received their appointment; and since no
one else could reward them, so no one else had a right
to rule them.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> As they were messengers sent by the
Almighty, they were rightly termed angels, and it was
the duty of the people to listen to their minister, as if
he really were an angel who had descended upon earth.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
His parishioners, therefore, were bound, not only to acknowledge
him and provide for him, but also to submit
to him.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Indeed, no one could refuse obedience, who
considered who the clergy were, and what functions they
performed. Besides being ambassadors and angels, they
were watchmen, who spied out every danger, and whose
sleepless vigilance protected the faithful.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the joy and delight of the earth. They were musicians,
singing the songs of sweetness; nay, they were sirens,
who sought to allure men from the evil path, and save
them from perishing.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> They were chosen arrows, stored
up in the quiver of God.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> They were burning lights
and shining torches. Without them, darkness would
prevail; but their presence illumined the world, and
made things clear.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Hence they were called stars,
which title also expressed the eminence of their office,
and its superiority over all others.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> To make this still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
more apparent, prodigies were vouchsafed, and strange
lights might occasionally be seen, which, hovering round
the form of the minister, confirmed his supernatural
mission.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> The profane wished to jest at these things,
but they were too notorious to be denied; and there
was a well-known case, in which, at the death of a
clergyman, a star was miraculously exhibited in the
firmament, and was seen by many persons, although it
was then midday.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this to be regarded as a solitary occurrence.
On the contrary, it usually happened, that when a
Scotch minister departed from this life, the event was
accompanied by portents, in order that the people might
understand that something terrible was going on, and
that they were incurring a serious, perhaps an irretrievable,
loss. Sometimes the candles would be mysteriously
extinguished, without any wind, and without any one
touching them.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Sometimes, even when the clergyman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
was preaching, the supernatural appearance of an animal
would announce his approaching end in face of the congregation,
who might vainly mourn what they were
unable to avert.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Sometimes the body of the holy man
would remain for years unchanged and undecayed;
death not having the power over it which it would have
had over the corpse of a common person.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> On other
occasions, notice was given to him of his death, years
before it occurred;<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> and, to strike greater awe into the
public mind, it was remarked, that when one minister
died, others were taken away at the same time, so that,
the bereavement being more widely felt, men might, by
the magnitude of the shock, be rendered sensible of the
inestimable value of those preachers whose lives were
happily spared.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, moreover, generally understood, that a minister,
during his abode in this world, was miraculously
watched over and protected. He was peculiarly
favoured by angels, who, though they did good offices
to all members of the true church, were especially
kind to the clergy;<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> and it was well known, that the
celebrated Rutherford, when only four years old,
having fallen into a well, was pulled out by an angel,
who came there for the purpose of saving his life.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
Another clergyman, who was in the habit of oversleeping
himself, used to be roused to his duty in the
morning, by three mysterious knocks at his door,
which, if they did not produce a proper effect, were
repeated close to his bed. These knocks never failed
on Sunday, and on days when he had to administer the
communion; and they lasted during the whole of his
ministry, until he became old and infirm, when they
entirely ceased.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>By the propagation of these and similar stories, in
a country already prepared for their reception, the
Scotch mind became imbued with a belief in miraculous
interposition, to an extent which would be utterly incredible
if it were not attested by a host of contemporary
and unimpeachable witnesses. The clergy,
partly because they shared in the general delusion, and
partly because they derived benefit from it, did every
thing they could to increase the superstition of their
countrymen, and to familiarize them with notions of the
supernatural world, such as can only be paralleled in
the monastic legends of the middle ages.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> How they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
laboured to corrupt the national intellect, and how
successful they were in that base vocation, has been
hitherto known to no modern reader; because no one
has had the patience to peruse their interminable discourses,
commentaries, and the other religious literature
in which their sentiments are preserved. As,
however, the preachers were, in Scotland, more influential
than all other classes put together, it is only
by comparing their statements with what is to be found
in the general memoirs and correspondence of the
time, that we can at all succeed in reconstructing the
history of a period, which, to the philosophic student
of the human mind, is full of great, though melancholy,
interest. I shall, therefore, make no apology for entering
into still further details respecting these matters;
and I hope to put the reader in possession of such facts
as will connect the past history of Scotland with its
present state, and will enable him to understand why
it is, that so great a people are, in many respects, still
struggling in darkness, simply because they still live
under the shadow of that long and terrible night,
which for more than a century, covered the land. It
will also appear, that their hardness and moroseness of
character, their want of gaiety, and their indifference
to many of the enjoyments of life, are traceable to the
same cause, and are the natural product of the gloomy
and ascetic opinions inculcated by their religious
teachers. For, in that age, as in every other, the
clergy, once possessed of power, showed themselves
harsh and unfeeling masters. They kept the people
in a worse than Egyptian bondage, inasmuch as they
enslaved mind as well as body, and not only deprived
men of innocent amusements, but taught them that
those amusements were sinful. And so thoroughly
did they do their work, that, though a hundred and
fifty years have elapsed since their supremacy began
to wane, the imprint of their hands is everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
discernible. The people still bear the marks of the
lash; the memory of their former servitude lives among
them; and they crouch before their clergy as they did
of old, abandoning their rights, sacrificing their independence,
and yielding up their consciences, to the
dictates of an intolerant and ambitious priesthood.</p>

<p>Of all the means of intimidation employed by the
Scotch clergy, none was more efficacious than the doctrines
they propounded respecting evil spirits and
future punishment. On these subjects they constantly
uttered the most appalling threats. The language,
which they used, was calculated to madden men with
fear, and to drive them to the depths of despair.
That it often had this consequence, and produced most
fatal results, we shall presently see. And, what made
it more effectual was, that it completely harmonized
with those other gloomy and ascetic notions which the
clergy inculcated, and according to which, pleasures
being regarded as sinful, sufferings were regarded as
religious. Hence that love of inflicting pain, and that
delight in horrible and revolting ideas, which characterized
the Scotch mind during the seventeenth
century. A few specimens of the prevailing opinions
will enable the reader to understand the temper of
the time, and to appreciate the resources which the
Scotch clergy could wield, and the materials with
which they built up the fabric of their power.</p>

<p>It was generally believed, that the world was overrun
by evil spirits, who not only went up and down the
earth, but also lived in the air, and whose business it
was to tempt and hurt mankind.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Their number was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
infinite, and they were to be found at all places and in
all seasons. At their head was Satan himself, whose
delight it was to appear in person, ensnaring or terrifying
every one he met.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> With this object, he assumed
various forms. One day, he would visit the earth as a
black dog;<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> on another day, as a raven;<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> on another,
he would be heard in the distance, roaring like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
bull.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> He appeared sometimes as a white man in
black clothes;<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> and sometimes he came as a black
man in black clothes, when it was remarked that his
voice was ghastly, that he wore no shoes, and that one
of his feet was cloven.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> His stratagems were endless.
For, in the opinion of divines, his cunning increased
with his age; and having been studying for more than
five thousand years, he had now attained to unexampled
dexterity.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> He could, and he did, seize both men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
women, and carry them away through the air.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
Usually, he wore the garb of laymen, but it was said,
that, on more than one occasion, he had impudently
attired himself as a minister of the gospel.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> At all
events, in one dress or other, he frequently appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the clergy, and tried to coax them over to his side.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> In
that, of course, he failed; but, out of the ministry, few,
indeed, could withstand him. He could raise storms
and tempests; he could work, not only on the mind,
but also on the organs of the body, making men hear
and see whatever he chose.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> Of his victims, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
he prompted to commit suicide,<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> others to commit
murder.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> Still, formidable as he was, no Christian
was considered to have attained to a full religious experience,
unless he had literally seen him, talked to
him, and fought with him.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> The clergy were constantly
preaching about him, and preparing their audience
for an interview with their great enemy. The
consequence was, that the people became almost crazed
with fear. Whenever the preacher mentioned Satan,
the consternation was so great, that the church resounded
with sighs and groans.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> The aspect of a
Scotch congregation in those days, is, indeed, hard
for us to conceive. Not unfrequently the people, benumbed
and stupefied with awe, were rooted to their
seats by the horrible fascination exercised over them,
which compelled them to listen, though they are described
as gasping for breath, and with their hair
standing on end.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Such impressions were not easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
effaced. Images of terror were left on the mind, and
followed the people to their homes, and in their daily
pursuits. They believed that the devil was always,
and literally, at hand; that he was haunting them,
speaking to them, and tempting them. There was
no escape. Go where they would, he was there. A
sudden noise, nay, even the sight of an inanimate
object, such as a stone, was capable of reviving the
association of ideas, and of bringing back to the
memory the language uttered from the pulpit.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Nor is it strange that this should be the case. All
over Scotland, the sermons were, with hardly an exception,
formed after the same plan, and directed to
the same end. To excite fear, was the paramount
object.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> The clergy boasted, that it was their special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
mission to thunder out the wrath and curses of the
Lord.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> In their eyes, the Deity was not a beneficent
being, but a cruel and remorseless tyrant. They
declared that all mankind, a very small portion only
excepted, were doomed to eternal misery. And when
they came to describe what that misery was, their
dark imaginations revelled and gloated at the prospect.
In the pictures which they drew, they reproduced and
heightened the barbarous imagery of a barbarous age.
They delighted in telling their hearers, that they
would be roasted in great fires, and hung up by their
tongues.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> They were to be lashed with scorpions,
and see their companions writhing and howling around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
them.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> They were to be thrown into boiling oil and
scalding lead.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> A river of fire and brimstone, broader
than the earth, was prepared for them;<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> in that, they
were to be immersed; their bones, their lungs, and
their liver, were to boil, but never be consumed.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
At the same time, worms were to prey upon them;
and while these were gnawing at their bodies, they
were to be surrounded by devils, mocking and making
pastime of their pains.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Such were the first stages
of suffering, and they were only the first. For the
torture, besides being unceasing, was to become gradually
worse. So refined was the cruelty, that one
hell was succeeded by another; and, lest the sufferer
should grow callous, he was, after a time, moved on,
that he might undergo fresh agonies in fresh places,
provision being made that the torment should not pall
on the sense, but should be varied in its character, as
well as eternal in its duration.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was the work of the God of the Scotch
clergy.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> It was not only his work, it was his joy
and his pride. For, according to them, hell was
created before man came into the world; the Almighty,
they did not scruple to say, having spent his previous
leisure in preparing and completing this place of torture,
so that, when the human race appeared, it might
be ready for their reception.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> Ample, however, as
the arrangements were, they were insufficient; and
hell, not being big enough to contain the countless
victims incessantly poured into it, had, in these latter
days, been enlarged.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> There was now sufficient room.
But in that vast expanse there was no void, for the
whole of it reverberated with the shrieks and yells of
undying agony.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> They rent the air with horrid
sound, and, amid their pauses, other scenes occurred,
if possible, still more excruciating. Loud reproaches
filled the ear: children reproaching their parents, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
servants reproaching their masters. Then, indeed,
terror was rife, and abounded on every side. For,
while the child cursed his father, the father, consumed
by remorse, felt his own guilt; and both children and
fathers made hell echo with their piercing screams,
writhing in convulsive agony at the torments which
they suffered, and knowing that other torments more
grievous still were reserved for them.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>Even now such language freezes the blood, when we
consider what must have passed through the minds of
those who could bring themselves to utter it. The
enunciation of such ideas unfolds the character of the
men, and lays bare their inmost spirit. We shudder,
when we think of the dark and corrupted fancy, the
vindictive musings, the wild, lawless, and uncertain
thoughts which must have been harboured by those
who could combine and arrange the different parts of
this hideous scheme. No hesitation, no compunction,
no feelings of mercy, ever seem to have entered their
breasts. It is evident, that their notions were well
matured; it is equally evident, that they delighted in
them. They were marked by a unity of conception,
and were enforced with a freshness and vigour of
language, which shows that their heart was in their
work. But before this could have happened, they
must have been dead to every emotion of pity and
tenderness. Yet, they were the teachers of a great
nation, and were, in every respect, the most influential
persons in that nation. The people, credulous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
grossly ignorant, listened and believed. We, at this
distance of time, and living in another realm of thought,
can form but a faint conception of the effect which
these horrible conceits produced upon them. They
were convinced that, in this world, they were incessantly
pursued by the devil, and that he, and other
evil spirits, were constantly hovering around them, in
bodily and visible shape, tempting them, and luring
them on to destruction. In the next world, the most
frightful and unheard-of punishments awaited them;
while both this world and the next were governed by
an avenging Deity, whose wrath it was impossible to
propitiate. No wonder that, with these ideas before
them, their reason should often give way, and that a
religious mania should set in, under whose influence
they, in black despair, put an end to their lives.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Little comfort, indeed, could men then gain from
their religion. Not only the devil, as the author of all
evil, but even He whom we recognise as the author of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
all good, was, in the eyes of the Scotch clergy, a cruel
and vindictive being, moved with anger like themselves.
They looked into their own hearts, and there they found
the picture of their God. According to them, He was a
God of terror, instead of a God of love.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> To Him they
imputed the worst passions of their own peevish and
irritable nature. They ascribed to Him, revenge, cunning,
and a constant disposition to inflict pain. While
they declared that nearly all mankind were sinners beyond
the chance of redemption, and were, indeed, predestined
to eternal ruin, they did not scruple to accuse
the Deity of resorting to artifice against these unhappy
victims; lying in wait for them, that He might catch
them unawares.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The Scotch clergy taught their
hearers, that the Almighty was so sanguinary, and so
prone to anger, that He raged even against walls and
houses and senseless creatures, wreaking His fury more
than ever, and scattering desolation on every side.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
Sooner than miss His fell and malignant purpose, He
would, they said, let loose avenging angels, to fall upon
men and upon their families.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Independently of this
resource, He had various ways whereby He could at once
content Himself and plague His creatures, as was
particularly shown in the devices which He employed
to bring famine on a people.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> When a country was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
starving, it was because God, in His anger, had smitten
the soil, had stopped the clouds from yielding their moisture,
and thus made the fruits of the earth to wither.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
All the intolerable sufferings caused by a want of food, the
slow deaths, the agony, the general misery, the crimes
which that misery produced, the anguish of the mother
as she saw her children wasting away and could give
them no bread, all this was His act, and the work of His
hands.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> In His anger, He would sometimes injure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
crops by making the spring so backward, and the
weather so cold and rainy, as to insure a deficiency in
the coming harvest.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Or else, he would deceive men,
by sending them a favourable season, and, after letting
them toil and sweat in the hope of an abundant supply,
He would, at the last moment, suddenly step in, and
destroy the corn just as it was fit to be reaped.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> For,
the God of the Scotch Kirk was a God who tantalized
His creatures as well as punished them; and when He
was provoked, He would first allure men by encouraging
their expectations, in order that their subsequent misery
might be more poignant.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>Under the influence of this horrible creed, and from
the unbounded sway exercised by the clergy who advocated
it, the Scotch mind was thrown into such a state,
that, during the seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth,
century, some of the noblest feelings of which our nature
is capable, the feelings of hope, of love, and of gratitude,
were set aside, and were replaced by the dictates of a
servile and ignominous fear. The physical sufferings
to which the human frame is liable, nay, even the very
accidents to which we are casually exposed, were believed
to proceed, not from our ignorance, nor from our carelessness,
but from the rage of the Deity. If a fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
chanced to break out in Edinburgh, the greatest alarm
was excited, because it was the voice of God crying out
against a luxurious and dissolute city.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> If a boil or a
sore appeared on your body, that, too, was a divine

might lawfully be cured.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> The small-pox, being one
of the most fatal as well as one of the most loathsome of
all diseases, was especially sent by God; and, on that
account, the remedy of inoculation was scouted as a
profane attempt to frustrate His intentions.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Other

His power was displayed, not by increasing the happiness
of men, nor by adding to their comforts, but by
hurting and vexing them in all possible ways. His
hand, always raised against the people, would sometimes
deprive them of wine by causing the vintage to fail;<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>

His wrath by making the weather excessively dry;<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>
sometimes, by making it equally wet.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> He was always
punishing; always busy in increasing the general suffering,

creature smart under the rod.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Every fresh war was
the result of His special interference; it was not caused
by the meddling folly or insensate ambition of statesmen,
but it was the immediate work of the Deity, who
was thus made responsible for all the devastations, the
murders, and other crimes more horrible still, which war
produces.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> In the intervals of peace, which, at that
period, were very rare, He had other means of vexing
mankind. The shock of an earthquake was a mark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
His displeasure;<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> a comet was a sign of coming tribulation;<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
and when an eclipse appeared, the panic was
so universal, that persons of all ranks hastened to
church to deprecate His wrath.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> What they heard
there, would increase their fear, instead of allaying it.
For the clergy taught their hearers, that even so ordinary
an event as thunder, was meant to excite awe,
and was sent for the purpose of showing to men with
how terrible a master they had to deal.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Not to
tremble at thunder, was, therefore, a mark of impiety;
and, in this respect, man was unfavourably contrasted
with the lower animals, since they were invariably
moved by this symptom of divine power.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>These visitations, eclipses, comets, earthquakes, thunder,
famine, pestilence, war, disease, blights in the air,
failures in the crops, cold winters, dry summers, these,
and the like, were, in the opinion of the Scotch divines,
outbreaks of the anger of the Almighty against the sins
of men; and that such outbreaks were incessant is not
surprising, when we consider that, in the same age, and
according to the same creed, the most innocent, and even
praiseworthy, actions were deemed sinful, and worthy
of chastisement. The opinions held on this subject are
not only curious, but extremely instructive. Besides
forming an important part of the history of the human
mind, they supply decisive proof of the danger of allowing
a single profession to exalt itself above all other
professions. For, in Scotland, as elsewhere, directly
the clergy succeeded in occupying a more than ordinary
amount of public attention, they availed themselves of
that circumstance to propagate those ascetic doctrines,
which, while they strike at the root of human happiness,
benefit no one except the class which advocates them.
That class, indeed, can hardly fail to reap advantage
from a policy, which, by increasing the apprehensions to
which the ignorance and timidity of men make them too
liable, does also increase their eagerness to fly for support
to their spiritual advisers. And the greater the
apprehension, the greater the eagerness. Of this, the
Scotch clergy, who were perfect masters of their own
art, were well aware. Under their influence, a system
of morals was established, which, representing nearly
every act as sinful, kept the people in perpetual dread,
lest unwittingly they were committing some enormous
offence, which would bring upon their heads a signal
and overwhelming punishment.</p>

<p>According to this code, all the natural affections, all
social pleasures, all amusements, and all the joyous instincts
of the human heart were sinful, and were to be
rooted out. It was sinful for a mother to wish to have
sons;<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> and, if she had any, it was sinful to be anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
about their welfare.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> It was a sin to please yourself,
or to please others; for, by adopting either course, you
were sure to displease God.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> All pleasures, therefore,
however slight in themselves, or however lawful they
might appear, must be carefully avoided.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> When
mixing in society, we should edify the company, if the
gift of edification had been bestowed upon us; but we
should by no means attempt to amuse them.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Cheerfulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
especially when it rose to laughter, was to be
guarded against; and we should choose for our associates
grave and sorrowful men, who were not likely to indulge
in so foolish a practice.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Smiling, provided it stopped
short of laughter, might occasionally be allowed; still,
being a carnal pastime, it was a sin to smile on Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>
Even on week-days, those who were most imbued
with religious principles hardly ever smiled, but
sighed, groaned, and wept.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> A true Christian would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
be careful, in his movements, to preserve invariable
gravity, never running, but walking soberly, and not
treading out in a brisk and lively manner, as unbelievers
are wont to do.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> So, too, if he wrote to a friend, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
must beware lest his letter should contain any thing like
jocoseness; since jesting is incompatible with a holy and
serious life.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>It was, moreover, wrong to take pleasure in beautiful
scenery; for a pious man had no concern with such
matters, which were beneath him, and the admiration
of which should be left to the unconverted.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> The unregenerate
might delight in these vanities, but they who
were properly instructed, saw Nature as she really was,
and knew that as she, for about five thousand years, had
been constantly on the move, her vigour was well-nigh
spent, and her pristine energy had departed.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> To the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
eye of ignorance, she still seemed fair and fresh; the
fact, however, was, that she was worn out and decrepit;
she was suffering from extreme old age; her frame, no
longer elastic, was leaning on one side, and she soon
would perish.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> Owing to the sin of man, all things
were getting worse, and nature was degenerating so fast,
that already the lilies were losing their whiteness, and
the roses their smell.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> The heavens were waxing
old;<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> the very sun, which lighted the earth, was becoming
feeble.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> This universal degeneracy was sad to
think of; but the profane knew it not. Their ungodly
eyes were still pleased by what they saw. Such was
the result of their obstinate determination to indulge
the senses, all of which were evil; the eye being, beyond
comparison, the most wicked. Hence, it was especially
marked out for divine punishment; and, being constantly
sinning, it was afflicted with fifty-two different diseases,
that is, one disease for each week in the year.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>On this account, it was improper to care for beauty
of any kind; or, to speak more accurately, there was no
real beauty. The world afforded nothing worth looking
at, save and except the Scotch Kirk, which was incomparably
the most beautiful thing under heaven.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> To
look at that was a lawful enjoyment, but every other
pleasure was sinful. To write poetry, for instance, was
a grievous offence, and worthy of especial condemnation.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
To listen to music was equally wrong; for men
had no right to disport themselves in such idle recreation.
Hence the clergy forbade music to be introduced
even during the festivities of a marriage;<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> neither
would they permit, on any occasion, the national entertainment
of pipers.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> Indeed, it was sinful to look at
any exhibition in the streets, even though you only
looked at it from your own window.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Dancing was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
extremely sinful, that an edict, expressly prohibiting it,
was enacted by the General Assembly, and read in every
church in Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> New Year's Eve had long been
a period of rejoicing in Scotland, as in other parts of
Europe. The Church laid her hands on this also, and
ordered that no one should sing the songs usual on that
day, or should admit such singers into his own private
house.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>At the christening of a child, the Scotch were accustomed
to assemble their relations, including their distant
cousins, in whom, then as now, they much abounded.
But this caused pleasure, and pleasure was sinful. It
was, therefore, forbidden; the number of guests was
limited; and the strictest supervision was exercised by
the clergy, to prevent the possibility of any one being
improperly happy on such occasions.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only at baptisms, but also at marriages, the same
spirit was displayed. In every country, it has been usual
to make merry at marriages; partly from a natural
feeling, and partly, perhaps, from a notion that a contract
so often productive of misery, might, at all events, begin
with mirth. The Scotch clergy, however, thought
otherwise. At the weddings of the poor, they would
allow no rejoicing;<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> and at the weddings of the rich,
it was the custom for one of them to go for the express
purpose of preventing an excess of gaiety. A better
precaution could hardly be devised; but they did not
trust exclusively to it. To check the lusts of the flesh,
they, furthermore, took into account the cookery, the
choice of the meats, and the number of the dishes. They
were, in fact, so solicitous on these points, and so
anxious that the nuptial feast should not be too attractive
that they fixed its cost, and would not allow any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
person to exceed the sum which they thought proper to
name.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>Nothing escaped their vigilance. For, in their opinion,
even the best man was, at his best time, so full of
turpitude, that his actions could not fail to be wicked.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
He never passed a day without sinning, and the smallest
sin deserved eternal wrath.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Indeed, every thing he
did was sinful, no matter how pure his motives.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Man
had been gradually falling lower and lower, and had
now sunk to a point of debasement, which made him
inferior to the beasts that perish.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> Even before he was
born, and while he was yet in his mother's womb, his
guilt began.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> And when he grew up, his crimes multiplied
thick and fast; one of the most heinous of them
being the practice of teaching children new words,&mdash;a
horrible custom, justly visited by divine wrath.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
however, was but one of a series of innumerable and incessant
offences; so that the only wonder was, that the
earth could restrain herself at the hideous spectacle
which man presented, and that she did not open her
mouth, as of old, and swallow him even in the midst of
his wickedness.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> For, it was certain, that in the whole

as he.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>Such being the case, it behoved the clergy to come
forward, and to guard men against their own vices, by
controlling their daily actions, and forcing them to a
right conduct. This they did vigorously. Aided by
the elders, who were their tools and the creatures of their
power, they, all over Scotland, organized themselves into
legislative bodies, and, in the midst of their little senate,
they enacted laws which the people were bound to obey.
If they refused, woe be to them. They became unruly
sons of the Church, and were liable to be imprisoned, to
be fined, or to be whipped,<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> or to be branded with a hot
iron,<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> or to do penance before the whole congregation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
humbling themselves, bare-footed, and with their hair
cut on one side,<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> while the minister, under pretence
of rebuking them, enjoyed his triumph.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> All this was
natural enough. For the clergy were the delegates of
heaven, and the interpreters of its will. They, therefore,
were the best judges of what men ought to do; and any
one whom they censured was bound to submit with
humility and repentance.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>The arbitrary and irresponsible tribunals, which now
sprung up all over Scotland, united the executive authority
with the legislative, and exercised both functions at
the same time. Declaring that certain acts ought not to
be committed, they took the law into their own hands,
and punished those who had committed them. According
to the principles of this new jurisprudence, of which the
clergy were the authors, it became a sin for any Scotchman
to travel in a Catholic country.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> It was a sin for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>

doubtful whether swimming was lawful for a Christian
at any time, even on week-days, and it was certain that

have been taken for granted; seeing that the Scotch

Either to make money, or to save it, was unsuited to
Christians; and even to possess much of it was objectionable,
because it not only ministered to human pleasures,
but encouraged those habits of foresight and of
provision for the future, which are incompatible with
complete resignation to the Divine will. To wish for
more than was necessary to keep oneself alive, was a sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
as well as a folly, and was a violation of the subjection
we owe to God.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> That it was contrary to His desire,
was, moreover, evident, from the fact that He bestowed
wealth liberally upon misers and covetous men; a remarkable
circumstance, which, in the opinion of Scotch
divines, proved that He was no lover of riches, otherwise
He would not give them to such base and sordid
persons.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>To be poor, dirty, and hungry, to pass through life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in misery, and to leave it with fear, to be plagued with
boils, and sores, and diseases of every kind, to be always
sighing and groaning, to have the face streaming with
tears, and the chest heaving with sobs, in a word, to
suffer constant affliction, and to be tormented in all
possible ways; to undergo these things was deemed a
proof of goodness, just as the contrary was a proof of
evil. It mattered not what a man liked; the mere fact
of his liking it, made it sinful. Whatever was natural,
was wrong. The clergy deprived the people of their
holidays, their amusements, their shows, their games,
and their sports; they repressed every appearance of joy,
they forbade all merriment, they stopped all festivities,
they choked up every avenue by which pleasure could
enter, and they spread over the country an universal
gloom.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> Then, truly, did darkness sit on the land.
Men, in their daily actions and in their very looks, became
troubled, melancholy, and ascetic. Their countenance
soured, and was downcast. Not only their opinions,
but their gait, their demeanour, their voice, their general
aspect, were influenced by that deadly blight which
nipped all that was genial and warm. The way of life
fell into the sear and yellow leaf; its tints gradually
deepened; its bloom faded, and passed off; its spring,
its freshness, and its beauty, were gone; joy and love
either disappeared or were forced to hide themselves in
obscure corners, until at length the fairest and most
endearing parts of our nature, being constantly repressed,
ceased to bear fruit, and seemed to be withered into
perpetual sterility.</p>

<p>Thus it was, that the national character of the Scotch
was, in the seventeenth century, dwarfed and mutilated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
With nations, as with individuals, the harmony and
free development of life can only be attained by exercising
its principal functions boldly and without fear.
Those functions are of two kinds; one set of them increasing
the happiness of the mind, another set increasing
the happiness of the body. If we could suppose a
man completely perfect, we should take for granted
that he would unite these two forms of pleasure in the
highest degree, and would extract, both from body and
mind, every enjoyment consistent with his own happiness,
and with the happiness of others. But, as no
such character is to be found, it invariably occurs, that
even the wisest of us are unable to hold the balance;
we, therefore, err, some in over-indulging the body,
some in over-indulging the mind. Comparing one set
of indulgences with the other, there can be no doubt
that the intellectual pleasures are, in many respects,
superior to the physical; they are more numerous,
more varied, more permanent, and more ennobling;
they are less liable to cause satiety in the individual,
and they produce more good to the species. But for
one person who can enjoy intellectual pleasures, there
are at least a hundred who can enjoy physical pleasures.
The happiness derived from gratifying the senses,
being thus diffused over a wider area, and satisfying, at
any given moment, a greater number of persons than
the other form of happiness is capable of, does, on that
account, possess an importance which many who call
themselves philosophers are unwilling to recognize.
Too often have philosophic and speculative thinkers, by
a foolish denunciation of such pleasures, done all in
their power to curtail the quantity of happiness of
which humanity is susceptible. Forgetting that we
have bodies as well as minds, and forgetting, too, that
in an immense majority of instances the body is more
active than the mind, that it is more powerful, that it
plays a more conspicuous part, and is fitted for greater
achievements, such writers commit the enormous error
of despising that class of actions to which ninety-nine
men out of every hundred are most prone, and for
which they are best fitted. And for committing this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
error they pay the penalty of finding their books unread,
their systems disregarded, and their scheme of
life adopted, perhaps, by a small class of solitary
students, but shut out from that great world of reality
for which it is unsuited, and in which it would produce
the most serious mischief.</p>

<p>If, then, we review the history of opinion in connexion
with the history of action, we may probably
say, that the ascetic notions of philosophers, such, for
instance, as the doctrines of the Stoics, and similar
theories of mortification, have not worked the harm
which might have been expected, and have not succeeded
in abridging, to any perceptible extent, the
substantial happiness of mankind. There are, I apprehend,
two reasons why they have failed. In the first
place, these philosophers have, with hardly an exception,
had little real acquaintance with human nature,
and have, therefore, been unable to touch those chords,
and appeal to those hidden motives, by influencing
which one man gains over another to his side. And,
in the second place, they, fortunately for us, have never
possessed authority, and have, therefore, been unable
either to enforce their doctrine by penalties, or to recommend
it by rewards.</p>

<p>But, though philosophers have failed in their effort
to lessen the pleasures of mankind, there is another
body of men, who, in making the same attempt, have
met with far greater success. I mean, of course, the
theologians, who, considered as a class, have, in every
country and in every age, deliberately opposed themselves
to gratifications which are essential to the
happiness of an overwhelming majority of the human
race. Raising up a God of their own creation, whom
they hold out as a lover of penance, of sacrifice, and of
mortification, they, under this pretence, forbid enjoyments
which are not only innocent, but praiseworthy.
For, every enjoyment by which no one is injured, is
innocent; and every innocent enjoyment is praiseworthy,
because it assists in diffusing that spirit of content
and of satisfaction which is favourable to the practice
of benevolence towards others. The theologians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
however, for reasons which I have already stated,
cultivate an opposite spirit, and, whenever they have
possessed power, they have always prohibited a large
number of pleasurable actions, on the ground that such
actions are offensive to the Deity. That they have no
warrant for this, and that they are simply indulging in
peremptory assertions on subjects respecting which we
have no trustworthy information, is well known to
those who, impartially, and without preconceived bias,
have studied their arguments, and the evidence which
they adduce. On this, however, I need not dilate; for,
inasmuch as men are, almost every year, and certainly
every generation, becoming more accustomed to close
and accurate reasoning, just in the same proportion is
the conviction spreading, that theologians proceed from
arbitrary assumptions, for which they have no proof,
except by appealing to other assumptions, equally arbitrary
and equally unproven. Their whole system
reposes upon fear, and upon fear of the worst kind;
since, according to them, the Great Author of our being
has used His omnipotence in so cruel a manner as to
endow his creatures with tastes, instincts, and desires,
which He not only forbids them to gratify, but which,
if they do gratify, shall bring on themselves eternal
punishment.</p>

<p>What the theologians are to the closet, that are the
priests to the pulpit. The theologians work upon the
studious, who read; the clergy act upon the idle, who
listen. Seeing, however, that the same man often performs
both offices, and seeing, too, that the spirit and tendency
of each office are the same, we may, for practical
purposes, consider the two classes as identical; and, putting
them together, and treating them as a whole, it must
be admitted by whoever will take a comprehensive
view of what they have actually done, that they have
been, not only the most bitter foes of human happiness,
but also the most successful ones. In their high and
palmy days, when they reigned supreme, when credulity
was universal and doubt unknown, they afflicted
mankind in every possible way; enjoining fasts, and
penances, and pilgrimages, teaching their simple and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
ignorant victims every kind of austerity, teaching them
to flog their own bodies, to tear their own flesh, and to
mortify the most natural of their appetites. This was
the state of Europe in the middle ages. It is still the
state of every part of the world where the priesthood are
uncontrolled. Such ascetic and self-tormenting observances
are the inevitable issue of the theological spirit,
if that spirit is unchecked. Now, and owing to the
rapid march of our knowledge, it is constantly losing
ground, because the scientific and secular spirit is encroaching
on its domain. Therefore, in our time, and
especially in our country, its most repulsive features
are disguised, and it is forced to mask its native
ugliness. Among our clergy, a habit of grave and
decent compromise has taken the place of that bold and
fiery war which their predecessors waged against a
sensual and benighted world. Their threats have perceptibly
diminished. They now allow us a little
pleasure, a little luxury, a little happiness. They no
longer tell us to mortify every appetite, and to forego
every comfort. The language of power has departed
from them. Here and there, we find vestiges of the
ancient spirit; but this is only among uneducated men,
addressing an ignorant audience. The superior clergy,
who have a character to lose, are grown cautious; and,
whatever their private opinion may be, they rarely venture
on those terrific denunciations with which their
pulpits once resounded, and which, in times of yore,
made the people shrink with fear, and humbled every
one except him by whom the denunciation was uttered.</p>

<p>Still, though much of this has vanished, enough
remains to show what the theological spirit is, and to
justify a belief, that nothing but the pressure of public
opinion prevents it from breaking out into its former
extravagance. Many of the clergy persist in attacking
the pleasures of the world, forgetting that, not only the
world, but all which the world contains, is the work of
the Almighty, and that the instincts and desires, which
they stigmatise as unholy, are part of his gifts to man.
They have yet to learn, that our appetites, being as
much a portion of ourselves as any other quality we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
possess, ought to be indulged, otherwise the whole individual
is not developed. If a man suppresses part of
himself, he becomes maimed and shorn. The proper
limit to self-indulgence is, that he shall neither hurt
himself nor hurt others. Short of this, everything is
lawful. It is more than lawful; it is necessary. He
who abstains from safe and moderate gratification of
the senses, lets some of his essential faculties fall into
abeyance, and must, on that account, be deemed imperfect
and unfinished. Such an one is incomplete; he is
crippled; he has never reached his full stature. He may
be a monk; he may be a saint; but a man he is not.
And now, more than ever, do we want true and genuine
men. No previous age has had so much work to do, and,
to accomplish that work, we need robust and vigorous
natures, whose every function has been freely exercised
without let or hindrance. Never before, was the practice
of life so arduous; never were the problems
presented to the human mind so numerous, or so complicated.
Every addition to our knowledge, every fresh
idea, opens up new difficulties, and gives birth to new
combinations. Under this accumulated pressure, we
shall assuredly sink, if we imitate the credulity of our
forefathers, who allowed their energies to be cramped
and weakened by those pernicious notions, which the
clergy, partly from ignorance, and partly from interest,
have, in every age, palmed on the people, and have,
thereby, diminished the national happiness, and retarded
the march of national prosperity.</p>

<p>In the same way, we constantly hear of the evils of
wealth, and of the sinfulness of loving money; although
it is certain that, after the love of knowledge, there is
no one passion which has done so much good to mankind
as the love of money. It is to the love of money
that we owe all trade and commerce; in other words,
the possession of every comfort and luxury which our
own country is unable to supply. Trade and commerce
have made us familiar with the productions of many
lands, have awakened curiosity, have widened our
ideas by bringing us in contact with nations of various
manners, speech, and thought, have supplied an outlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
for energies which would otherwise have been pent up
and wasted, have accustomed men to habits of enterprise,
forethought, and calculation, have, moreover,
communicated to us many arts of great utility, and
have put us in possession of some of the most valuable
remedies with which we are acquainted, either to save
life or to lessen pain. These things we owe to the love
of money. If theologians could succeed in their desire
to destroy that love, all these things would cease, and
we should relapse into comparative barbarism. The
love of money, like all our appetites, is liable to abuse;
but to declaim against it as evil in itself, and, above all,
to represent it as a feeling, the indulgence of which
provokes the wrath of God, is to betray an ignorance,
natural, perhaps, in former ages, but shameful in our
time, particularly when it proceeds from men who give
themselves out as public teachers, and profess that it is
their mission to enlighten the world.</p>

<p>Injurious, however, as all this is to the best interests
of society, it is nothing in comparison with the doctrines
formerly advocated by the Scotch divines. What their
ideas were, I have shown from their own sermons, the
reading of which has been the most painful literary task
I ever undertook, since, in addition to the narrowness
and the dogmatism which even the best of such compositions
contain, there is, in these productions, a hardness
of heart, an austerity of temper, a want of sympathy
with human happiness, and a hatred of human nature,
such as have rarely been exhibited in any age, and, I
rejoice to think, have never been exhibited in any other
Protestant country. These things, I have resuscitated
from the oblivion in which they had long been buried,
partly because it was necessary to do so in order to
understand the history of the Scotch mind, and partly
because I desired to show what the tendency of theologians
is, when that tendency is uncontrolled. Protestants,
generally, are too apt to suppose that there is
something in their creed which protects them against
those hurtful extravagances which have been, and,
to a certain extent, still are, practised in the Catholic
Church. Never was a greater mistake. There is but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
protection against the tyranny of any class; and that is,
to give that class very little power. Whatever the pretensions
of any body of men may be, however smooth
their language, and however plausible their claims, they
are sure to abuse power, if much of it is conferred on
them. The entire history of the world affords no instance
to the contrary. In Catholic countries, France
alone excepted, the clergy have more authority than in
Protestant countries. Therefore, in Catholic countries,
they do more harm than in Protestant countries, and
their peculiar views are developed with greater freedom.
The difference depends, not on the nature of the creed,
but on the power of the class. This is very apparent in
Scotland, where the clergy, being supreme, did, Protestants
though they were, imitate the ascetic, the unsocial,
and the cruel doctrines, which, in the Catholic
Church, gave rise to convents, fastings, scourgings, and
all the other appliances of an uncouth and ungenial
superstition.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Scotch divines, in some of their theories,
went beyond any section of the Catholic Church, except
the Spanish. They sought to destroy, not only human
pleasures, but also human affections. They held that
our affections are necessarily connected with our lusts,
and that we must, therefore, wean ourselves from them
as earthly vanities.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> A Christian had no business with
love or sympathy. He had his own soul to attend to,
and that was enough for him. Let him look to himself.
On Sunday, in particular, he must never think of benefiting
others; and the Scotch clergy did not hesitate to
teach the people, that on that day it was sinful to save a
vessel in distress, and that it was a proof of religion to
leave ship and crew to perish.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> They might go; none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
but their wives and children would suffer, and that was
nothing in comparison with breaking the Sabbath. So,
too, did the clergy teach, that on no occasion must food
or shelter be given to a starving man, unless his opinions
were orthodox.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> What need for him to live? Indeed,
they taught that it was a sin to tolerate his notions at
all, and that the proper course was, to visit him with
sharp and immediate punishment.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> Going yet further,
they broke the domestic ties, and set parents against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
their offspring. They taught the father to smite the
unbelieving child, and to slay his own boy sooner than
allow him to propagate error.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> As if this were not
enough, they tried to extirpate another affection, even
more sacred and more devoted still. They laid their
rude and merciless hands on the holiest passion of which
our nature is capable, the love of a mother for her son.
Into that sanctuary, they dared to intrude; into that, they
thrust their gaunt and ungentle forms. If a mother
held opinions of which they disapproved, they did not
scruple to invade her household, take away her children,
and forbid her to hold communication with them.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
Or if, perchance, her son had incurred their displeasure,
they were not satisfied with forcible separation, but they
laboured to corrupt her heart, and harden it against her
child, so that she might be privy to the act. In one of
these cases, mentioned in the records of the church of
Glasgow, the Kirk-Session of that town summoned before
them a woman, merely because she had received into
her house her own son, after the clergy had excommunicated
him. So effectually did they work upon her mind,
that they induced her to promise, not only that she would
shut her door against her child, but that she would aid
in bringing him to punishment. She had sinned in
loving him; she had sinned, even, in giving him shelter;
but, says the record, &lsquo;she promised not to do it again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and to tell the magistrates when he comes next to
her.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>She promised not to do it again. She promised to
forget him, whom she had born of her womb and
suckled at her breast. She promised to forget her
boy, who had ofttimes crept to her knees, who had slept
in her bosom, and whose tender frame she had watched
over and nursed. All the dearest associations of the
past, all that the most exquisite form of human affection
can give or receive, all that delights the memory, all
that brightens the prospect of life, all vanished, all passed
away from the mind of this poor woman, at the bidding
of her spiritual masters. At one fell swoop, all were
gone. So potent were the arts of these men, that they
persuaded the mother to conspire against her son, that
she might deliver him up to them. They defiled her
nature, by purging it of its love. From that day her
soul was polluted. She was lost to herself, as well as
lost to her son. To hear of such things is enough to
make one's blood surge again, and raise a tempest in
our inmost nature. But to have seen them, to have
lived in the midst of them, and yet not to have rebelled
against them, is to us utterly inconceivable, and proves
in how complete a thraldom the Scotch were held, and
how thoroughly their minds, as well as their bodies,
were enslaved.</p>

<p>What more need I say? What further evidence need
I bring to elucidate the real character of one of the most
detestable tyrannies ever seen on the earth? When the
Scotch Kirk was at the height of its power, we may
search history in vain for any institution which can compete
with it, except the Spanish Inquisition. Between
these two, there is a close and intimate analogy. Both
were intolerant, both were cruel, both made war upon
the finest parts of human nature, and both destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
every vestige of religions freedom. One difference,
however, there was, of vast importance. In political
matters, the Church, which was servile in Spain, was
rebellious in Scotland. Hence the Scotch always had
one direction in which they could speak and act with
unrestrained liberty. In politics, they found their vent.
There, the mind was free. And this was their salvation.
This saved them from the fate of Spain, by securing to
them the exercise of those faculties which otherwise
would have lain dormant, if, indeed, they had not been
entirely destroyed by that long and enfeebling servitude
in which their clergy retained them, and from which,
but for this favourable circumstance, no escape would
have been open.</p>

English for having inflicted so much suffering upon them, was intense
about the middle of the seventeenth century, notwithstanding the
temporary union of the two nations against Charles. In 1652, &lsquo;the
criminal record is full of cases of murder of English soldiers. They
were cut off by the people whenever a fitting opportunity occurred, and
were as much detested in Scotland as the French soldiers were in Spain
during the Peninsular war.&rsquo; <i>The Spottiswoode Miscellany</i>, vol. ii. p.

vanquished, and subdued, to that degree, that there was no place nor
person who made the least show of opposing Cromwell; who, by the
administration of Monk, made the yoke very grievous to the whole nation;
yet the preachers kept their pulpit license; and, more for the affront
that was offered to presbytery, than the conscience of what was due to
majesty, many of them presumed to pray for the king; and generally,
though secretly, exasperated the minds of the people against the present
government.&rsquo; <i>Clarendon's History of the Rebellion</i>, p. 803.</p></div>

to hear them preach. A writer of that time informs us that, even in
1648, when Cromwell was in Edinburgh, &lsquo;he went not to their churches;
but it is constantle reported that ewerie day he had sermons in his oune
ludginge, himself being the preacher, whensoewer the spirit came upon
him; which took him lyk the fitts of an ague, somtyms twise, sometyms

according to another contemporary, &lsquo;he made stables of all the churches

in them; riffled the ministers housses, and distrayed ther cornes.&rsquo;
<i>Balfour's Annales of Scotland</i>, vol. iv. p. 88. The clergy, on the
other hand, employing a resource with which their profession has always
been familiar, represented Cromwell as opposing Providence, because he
was opposing them. Rutherford (<i>Religious Letters</i>, reprinted Glasgow,
1824, p. 346) says, that he fought &lsquo;against the Lord's secret ones;&rsquo; and
Row (<i>Continuation of Blair's Autobiography</i>, p. 335), under the year
1658, triumphantly observes: &lsquo;In the beginning of September this year,
the Protector, that old fox, died. It was observed, as a remarkable cast
of divine providence, that he died upon the 3d of September, which he,
glorying of routing of our armies at Dunbar and Worcester on that day,
used to call <i>his day</i>. On that same very day the Just Judge called him
to an account,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p></div>

the best account is that given by Baillie, in a letter to Calamy, dated
Glasgow, 27th July 1653. He writes: &lsquo;That on the 20th of July last, when
our Generall Assemblie was sett in the ordinarie tyme and place,
Lieutenant-Colonell Cotterall besett the church with some rattes of
musqueteirs and a troup of horse; himself (after our fast, wherein Mr.
Dickson and Mr. Dowglas had two gracious sermons) entered the
Assemblie-house, and immediately after Mr. Dickson the Moderator his
prayer, required audience; wherein he inquired, If we did sitt there by
the authority of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England? or of
the Commanders-in-chiefe of the English forces? or of the English Judges
in Scotland? The Moderator replyed, That we were ane Ecclesiasticall
synod, ane Spirituall court of Jesus Christ, which medled not with
anything Civile; that our authoritie wes from God, and established by
the lawes of the land yet standing unrepealed; that, by the Solemn
League and Covenant, the most of the English army stood obliedged to
defend our Generall Assemblie. When some speeches of this kind had
passed, the Lieutenant-Colonell told us, his order was to dissolve us;
whereupon he commanded all of us to follow him, else he would drag us
out of the rowme. When we had entered a Protestation of this unheard-of
and unexampled violence, we did ryse and follow him; he ledd us all
through the whole streets a myle out of the towne, encompassing us with
foot-companies of musqueteirs, and horsemen without; all the people
gazing and mourning as at the saddest spectacle they had ever seen. When
he had ledd us a myle without the towne, he then declared what further
he had in commission, That we should not dare to meet any more above
three in number; and that against eight o'clock to-morrow, we should
depart the towne, under paine of being guiltie of breaking the publick
peace: And the day following, by sound of trumpet, we were commanded off
towne under the paine of present imprisonment. Thus our Generall
Assemblie, the glory and strength of our Church upon earth, is, by your
souldiarie, crushed and trod under foot, without the least provocatione
from us, at this time, either in word or deed.&rsquo; <i>Baillie's Letters and

wherein he satisfied their expectation fully. For, the main point he
drove at in his sermon, was to state an opposition betwixt King Charles
and King Jesus (as he was pleased to speak) and upon that account to
press resistance to King Charles for the interest of King Jesus. It may
be wondered that such doctrine should have relish'd with men brought up
in the knowledge of the Scriptures; and yet, such was the madness of the
times, that none who preach'd in public since the beginning of the
Troubles, had been so cried up as he was for that sermon.&rsquo; <i>Guthry's

the mids of many dangers and distresses, and much want and hardship),
and have been so farre instrumentall to the foyling and scattering of

of Dunbar. According to one, the defeat was intended to testify against
&lsquo;the great sin and wickedness&rsquo; of the people. <i>Naphtali, or the
Wrestlings of the Church of Scotland</i>, p. 75. According to the other, it
was owing to the anger of the Deity at the Scotch showing any favour to
the partizans of Charles. For, says the Reverend Alexander Shields,
&lsquo;both at that time, and since that time, the Lord never countenanced an
expedition where that malignant interest was taken in unto the state of
the quarrel. Upon this, our land was invaded by Oliver Cromwell, who
defeat our army at Dunbar, where the anger of the Lord was evidently
seen to smoke against us, for espousing that interest.&rsquo; <i>Shields' Hind

was in Scotland at the time, tells us, that the clergy assured the

assemblages, in whose meetings and proceedings the public take no
interest whatever, is defined to be the cognizance of parochial matters
and cases of scandal; but in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
especially during the Covenanting reign of terror after the outbreak of
the Civil War against Charles I., the kirk-sessions of Scotland were the
sources of excessive tyranny and oppression&mdash;were arbitrary,
inquisitorial, and revengeful, to an extent which exceeds all belief. It
is truly stated by the author of the &ldquo;Memoirs of Locheill&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Every
parish had a tyrant, who made the greatest Lord in his district stoop to
his authority. The kirk was the place where he kept his court; the
pulpit his throne or tribunal from whence he issued out his terrible
decrees; and twelve or fourteen sour ignorant enthusiasts, under the
title of Elders, composed his council. If any, of what quality soever,
had the assurance to disobey his orders, the dreadful sentence of
excommunication was immediately thundered out against him, his goods and
chattels confiscated and seized, and he himself being looked upon as
actually in the possession of the devil, and irretrievably doomed to
eternal perdition.&rdquo;&rsquo; Introduction to <i>The Kirk-Session Register of
Perth</i>, in <i>The Spottiswoode Miscellany</i>, vol. ii. pp. 229&ndash;230,

excommunication was supposed to involve, one of the most influential

Satan. &lsquo;That he who is excommunicated may be truly said to be delivered

to Mr. Welsh's wife), as his manner was, he entertained the company with
godly and edifying discourse, which was well received by all the company
save only one debauched Popish young gentleman, who sometimes laughed,
and sometimes mocked and made faces; whereupon Mr. Welsh brake out into
a sad abrupt charge upon all the company to be silent, and observe the
work of the Lord upon that profane mocker, which they should presently
behold; upon which immediately the profane wretch sunk down and died
beneath the table, but never returned to life again, to the great
astonishment of all the company.&rsquo; <i>History of Mr. John Welsh, Minister

Welsh being by the Captaine, set at the upper end, intertained the

save this young Papist, who, with laughter and derision, laboured to
silence him, which was little regarded by Mr. Welsh. But after supper,
while the guests sate a little, this youth stood up at the lower end of
the table, and while Mr. Welsh proceeded from grave to gracious
entertainment of his company, the youth came to that height of insolence
as with the finger to point at him and with the face to make flouting
grimaces, whereby he grieved the holy man, so as on a suddain he was
forced to a silence. The whole company, who had heard him with delight,
were silent with him. Within a little, Mr. Welsh, as moved by the spirit
of God, broke forth into these words: &ldquo;Gentlemen, the spirit of God is
provoked against us, and I shall intreat you not to be afraid to see
what God shall do among you before you rise from the table, for he will
smite some of you with death before you go hence.&rdquo; All were silently
astonished, waiting to see the issue with fear. And while every man
feared himselfe, except the insolent youth, he fel down dead suddenly at
the foot of the table to shew the power of God's jealousie against the
mockers of his Spirit and the offers of his grace.&rsquo; <i>Fleming's

forgote; and when the servant was rebuked, Mr. Hogg said, there was noe
matter, for he had one in his pocket, and it was a necessary companion
for a travailer; and, as his use was upon evry thing, he took occasion
to raise a spirituall discourse from it: &ldquo;If we wer soe carefull about
accommodations in our way here, what care should we take in our
spirituall journey!&rdquo; and the like; at which the factour takes a kink of
laughing. Mr. Hogg looked at him with a frown, and went on in his
discourse. Within a little, at somewhat or other, he laughed out yet
louder, and Mr. Hogg stoped a litle, and looked him very stern in the
face, and went on in his discourse, upon the free grace of God; and, at
some expression or other, the man fell a laughing and flouting very
loud: Upon which Mr. Hogg stoped, and directed his discourse to him, to
this purpose: &ldquo;Alace!&rdquo; sayes he, &ldquo;my soul is afflicted to say what I
must say to you, sir, and I am constrained and pressed in spirit to say
it, and cannot help it. Sir, you nou dispise the grace of God, and mock
at it; but I tell you, in the name of the Lord, that the time is coming,
and that very shortly, when you (will) seek ane offer of grace, but
shall not find it!&rdquo; Upon which the man arose, laughing and flouting, and
went to his room. After he was away, the lady asked Mr. Hogg, What he
thought would come upon him? He answered, he kneu noe more then he had
said, and that he was constrained and oblidged to say it against his
inclination; and he could not accompt for some of these impressions he
sometimes felt, and after Providences would clear, and that shortly; but
what it was, when, or where, he kneu not. The man told some of the
servants that a phanatick Minister had been pronouncing a curse on him,
but he did not value him nor it either. After Mr. Hogg had been somtime
with the lady, he went to his room; and after he had, as he used to doe,
spent some time in prayer, he putt off his cloaths, and just as he was
stepping into his bedd, a servant comes and knocks at the dore and
cryes, &ldquo;For the Lord's sake, Mr. Hogg, come doun staires, presently, to

gentlmen either in the parish or noturely knouen thereabout, who rose in
the time of the last sermon, and with their servants went out of (the
church), either to some fair or some race, not farr off. After sermon,
when Mr. Semple rose to give the ordinary advertisments, he began with
taking nottice of this, and said, he had remarked three gentlmen rise in
time of sermon, and contemptuously and boldly leave God's service to goe
to a fair, or race, as he supposed; but sayes, &ldquo;It's born in upon me,
and I am perswaded of it, the Lord will not suffer them to goe off time,
without some remarkable judgment, and I am much mistaken if the most
part that have seen them committ the sin, will not hear of the
punishment of such open despite to the ordinances of Christ.&rdquo; This
peremptoryness did very much surprize Lady H(enriett), and coming home
from sermon with my Lord Lothian and his Lady, in coach, she expressed
her surprize at it. My Lord Lothian said, &ldquo;The Minister is a man of God,
and I am perswaded not one word of his will fall to the ground!&rdquo; Within
some feu moneths, my Lord or my Lady, writing to Lady H(enriett),
signifyed to her, that one of these gentlmen was found in his room, (if
I forgett not), with his throat cutt; and a second, being drunk, fell
off his horse, and broke his neck; and some while after, shee heard the
third had dyed some violent death.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's Analecta</i>, vol. i. pp.

accompt, which he had from personall observation: When he lived near
Frazerburge, in the North, there was a minister settled there, <i>jure
devoluto</i>, the toun being biggotted against Presbytery to a pitch, and
only two or three that had any seeming liking that way. After the
Minister is setled, he expected much encouragement from one Ougstoun, I
think his name was, who had professed much respect for him
in that way. A while after, in some difficulty, the
Minister came to him, and desired his countenance and assistance in the
difficulty. He at first put the Minister off with delay: and within a
litle plainly mocked him, and would doe nothing. The Minister came from
him to my informer, who lived a litle from the place, and gave him ane
account (of) what had befallen him, and said, &ldquo;I expected much from that
man, and reaconed upon his help and assistance, in soe comfortless a
setlement as I have ventured on; and he has not only disappointed me,
but mocked me!&rdquo; And the Minister was like to sink under the thoughts of
this carriage; and after some silence, he said, very peremptorly, &ldquo;I am
much mistaken, yea, I'le say it, God hath sent me, and spoken by me. God
will visite that man, and something more than ordinary will befall him
and his!&rdquo; My informer was very much stunned and greived at such a
peremptory declaration. However, it was accomplished, to my informer's
personall knowledge. The man was a trader, who was very rich, worth near
four or five thousand pounds sterling in stock. He had two sons and two
daughters. Within some litle time, one of his sons turned distracted,
and I think continues soe still. The other son, in some distemper,
turned silly, and litle better, and dyed. His daughters, one was maryed,
and her husband lost all his stock at sea, twice or thrice; his
goodfather stocked him once or twice, and all was still lost, and they
and their children are miserable. The other daughter fell into a
distemper, wherein she lost her reason. The man himself, after that
time, never throve; his means wasted away insensibly; and throu all
things, he fell under melancholy, and turned silly, and dyed stupide.
All this fell out in some feu years after what passed above; and my
relator kneu all this particularly, and had occasion to be upon the
man's bussiness and affairs.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's Analecta</i>, vol. ii. pp. 175,

condition, had not the Lord prevented.&rsquo; p. 196. &lsquo;I, ignorant what
defences to make, had in my company a registrate horning, which I
accidentally and without premeditation (God putting it in my mind at the
same time) did cast in, by which he, being the king's rebel, was
incapacitate from pursuing me. And the Lord so ordered it that he never
after compeared to trouble me, by which means I was delivered from a
loss and a fashery, and had but one court to wait upon.&rsquo; p. 202. &lsquo;My
condition during this time was a wrestling condition with the sons of
Zeruiah that were too strong for me; little or no overcoming, yet
violent wrestling.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;For I humbled myself under the sense of the
calamities of our family, and my own particular wants; I besought him to
keep us from utter destruction. And the Lord was pleased to hear; <i>he
destroyed by death my chief adversaries</i>, I found shifts to pay my many
petty debts, gained our law-action, and was restored to some of my
ancient possessions again.&rsquo; pp. 227, 228.</p></div>

To arrest a clergyman on a civil or criminal process, was an act full of
danger, inasmuch as the Deity would hardly fail to avenge it. This
applied even to the officers who executed the arrest, as well as to him
by whom it was ordered. See, for instance, <i>Some Remarkable Passages of
the Life and Death of Mr. John Semple, Minister of the Gospel</i>, p. 171
(in <i>Walker's Biographia Presbyteriana</i>, vol. i.). &lsquo;Some time
thereafter, he gat orders to apprehend Mr. Semple; he intreated to
excuse him, for Mr. Semple was the minister and man he would not meddle
with; for he was sure, if he did that, some terrible mischief would
suddenly befal him. Mr. Arthur Coupar, who was Mr. Semple's precentor,
told these passages to a Reverend Minister in the church, yet alive,
worthy of all credit, who told me.&rsquo; Durham boasts that, &lsquo;when Ministers
have most to do, and <i>meet with most opposition</i>, God often furnisheth
them accordingly with more boldnesse, gifts, and assistance than
ordinary. Christ's witnesses are a terrible party; for as few as these
witnesses are, none of their opposits do gain at their hand; <i>whoever
hurteth them shall in this manner be killed</i>. Though they be despicable
in sackcloth, yet <i>better oppose a king in his strength, and giving
orders from his throne covered in cloath of state, than them</i>: though
they may burn some and imprison others, yet their opposers will pay
sickerly for it. This is not because of any worth that is in them, or
for their own sake; But 1. for His sake and for His authority that
sendeth them. 2. for the event of their word, which will certainly come
to passe, and that more terribly, and as certainly, as ever any
temporall judgement was brought on by Moses or Elias.&rsquo; <i>Durham's

Presbytery, and Synod of Aberdeen</i>, p. 58. It was not enough to go
occasionally to church; the attendance must be regular; otherwise the
clergy were dissatisfied, and punished the delinquents. In the
Presbytery Book of Strathbogie it is recorded that, on the 29th
September 1649, &lsquo;Mr. Johne Reidfurd being posed quhat diligence he had
vsed to the Lady Frendraught, reported, shoe had hard three sermons, and
so, as he thought, shoe intended to continow ane hearer. The bretheren,
considering her long continowed contumacie and delay of her process, by
<i>heiring a sermon now and then</i>, thought not <i>that kind of heiring
satufactorie</i>, quherfor Mr. Robert Watson, and Mr. Robert Irving, ver
ordained to goe with Mr. Johne Reidfurd, and requyre the said Lady to
subscryv the Covenant, quherby shoe might testifie her conformitie vith
the Kirk of Scotland, quhilk, if shoe refused, the said Mr. Johne vas
ordained to pronounce the sentence of excommunicatioun against hir
before the Provinciall Assemblie, as he vold be answerable therto.&rsquo;
<i>Extracts from the Presbytery Book of Strathbogie</i>, p. 115. Neither
distance, nor illness, might be pleaded as a valid excuse. Under no
circumstances, would the preachers tolerate the affront of any one
displaying an unwillingness to hear their sermons. In 1650, &lsquo;compeired
the Lord Oliphant, being summondit for not keeping his parish kirk of
Abercherdour, vho declared his inabilitie of bodie many tymes, and the
want of houses for accommodating him and his familie so farr distant
from the same, vas the onlie caus, quhilk he promised to amend in tym
comming. Mr. John Reidfurd ordained to report the same to the
presbytrie, and vpon his continowed absence, to processe him.&rsquo;

it was their duty to praise their own profession, not for their own

Messengers, intrusted by Him with a high and heavenly imployment; and it
is a title that should put Ministers in mind of their duty, to do God's

way, cheerfully, willingly and readily: and it <i>should put people in

&lsquo;Therefore are Ministers called Angels, and Angels, Ministers,&rsquo; p. 596.
Cockburn says that this is the reason why &lsquo;we should behave ourselves
decently and reverently&rsquo; in church; &lsquo;for if the presence of Kings
overawe us, how much more should the presence of God and Angels.&rsquo;
<i>Cockburn's Jacob's Vow, or Man's Felicity and Duty</i>, p. 356. Another
Scotch divine asserts that he and his brethren are able to instruct the
angels, and free them from their ignorance. See the audacious passage in
<i>Fergusson's Exposition of the Epistles of Paul</i>, p. 180: &lsquo;<i>This may
commend the ministers of the gospel not a little unto men</i>, and beget
reverence in them towards the same, that even the blessed angels are in
some sort bettered by it, and that it is therefore respected by them:
for Paul commendeth his office from this, that by occasion thereof &ldquo;unto
the principalities and powers, was made known the manifold wisdom of
God.&rdquo; Though angels be most knowing creatures, as enjoying the immediate
sight and presence of God, Matt. xviii. 10, yet <i>they are ignorant of
some things, which, by God's way of dispensing the Gospel to his church,
they come to a more full knowledge off</i>.&rsquo; After this, it is a slight
matter to find Monro insisting that &lsquo;the people should consider our
character as the most difficult and most sacred.&rsquo; <i>Monro's Sermons</i>, p.

morning. This, at first, in his youth, frighted him; but at lenth it
turned easy to him, and he believed these knocks and awaknings proceed
from a good art. That these never failed him on Sabbaths and at
Communions, when he was obliged to rise early: That when he turned old
and infirm, towards the close of his dayes, they intirely ceased and
left him.&rsquo; <i>Wodrow's Analecta</i>, vol. ii. p. 307. This work, in four
quarto volumes, is invaluable for the history of the Scotch mind; being
a vast repertory of the opinions and traditions of the clergy, during
the seventeenth, and early part of the eighteenth, century. Wodrow was a
man of ability, certainly above the average; his honesty is
unimpeachable, as the jealous scrutiny which the episcopalians have made
of his great work on the History of the Church of Scotland, decisively
proves; and he was in the constant habit of personal and epistolary
communication with the leading characters of his age. I have, therefore,
freely used his <i>Analecta</i>; also his <i>Collections upon the Lives of
Ministers</i>, which is likewise in four quarto volumes; and his
<i>Correspondence</i>, in three thick octavo volumes. It would be difficult
to find a more competent witness respecting the sentiments of his
ecclesiastical brethren. It would be impossible to find a more candid
one.</p></div>

hardly be instanced any great change, or revolution in the earth, which
hath not had some such extraordinary herald going before. Can the world
deny how sometimes these prodigious signes have been shaped out to point
at the very nature of the stroke then imminent, by a strange resemblance
to the same, such as a flaming sword in the air, the appearance of
armies fighting even sometimes upon the earth, to the view of many most
sober and judicious onlookers, also showers of blood, the noise of

that I had been provoking God some way or other in the duty, and that he

detected the cheat, and &lsquo;with ane awful seriousness appearing in his
countenance, began to tell the youth his hazard, and that the man whom
he took for a Minister was the Divel, who had trepanned him, and brought
him into his net; advised him to be earnest with God in prayer, and
likewise not to give way to dispair, for ther was yet hope.&rsquo; The
preacher had, on this occasion, been so far duped as to give the devil
&lsquo;a written promise&rsquo; to do whatever he was requested. As soon as the Rev.
Mr. Blair ascertained this fact, he took the young man before the
Presbytery, and narrated the circumstance to the members. &lsquo;They were all
strangely affected with it, and resolved unanimously to dispatch the
Presbitry business presently, and to stay all night in town, and on the
morrow to meet for prayer in one of the most retired churches of the
Presbitry, acquainting none with their business, (but) taking the youth
alongst with them, whom they keeped alwise close by them. Which was
done, and after the Ministers had prayed all of them round, except Mr.
Blair, who prayed last, in time of his prayer there came a violent
rushing of wind upon the church, so great that they thought the church
should have fallen down about their ears, and with that the youth's
paper and covenant&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> the covenant which he had signed at the
request of Satan) &lsquo;droops down from the roof of the church among the
Ministers.&rsquo;</p></div>

literature of that time, can form an idea of this, its almost universal
tendency. During about a hundred and twenty years, the Scotch pulpits
resounded with the most frightful denunciations. The sins of the people,
the vengeance of God, the activity of Satan, and the pains of hell, were
the leading topics. In this world, calamities of every kind were
announced as inevitable; they were immediately at hand; that generation,
perhaps that year, should not pass away without the worst evils which
could be conceived, falling on the whole country. I will merely quote
the opening of a sermon which is now lying before me, and which was
preached, in 1682, by no less a man than Alexander Peden. &lsquo;There is
three or four things that I have to tell you this day; and the first is
this, A bloody sword, a bloody sword, a bloody sword, for thee, O
Scotland, that shall reach the most part of you to the very heart. And
the second is this, Many a mile shall ye travel in thee, O Scotland! and
shall see nothing but waste places. The third is this, The most fertile
places in thee, O Scotland! shall be waste as the mountain tops. And
fourthly, The women with child in thee, O Scotland! shall be dashed in
pieces. And fifthly, There hath been many conventicles in thee, O
Scotland! but ere it be long, God shall have a conventicle in thee, that
shall make thee Scotland tremble. Many a preaching hath God wared on
thee, O Scotland! but ere it be long God's judgments shall be as
frequent in Scotland as these precious meetings, wherein he sent forth
his faithful servants to give faithful warning in his name of their
hazard in apostatizing from God, and in breaking all his noble vows. God
sent out a Welsh, a Cameron, a Cargill, and a Semple to preach to thee;
but ere long God shall preach to thee by a bloody sword.&rsquo; <i>Sermons by

but I am sure fourscore of you will not be saved;&rdquo; upon which, three of
his ignorant hearers being in despair, despatch'd themselves soon

rather panegyric, of Vetch in <i>Howie's Biographia Scoticana</i>, where this
circumstance is not denied, but, on the contrary, stated to be no
&lsquo;disparagement to him,&rsquo; p. 606. The frame of mind which the teachings of
the clergy encouraged, and which provoked self-murder, is vividly
depicted by Samuel Rutherford, the most popular of all the Scotch
divines of the seventeenth century. &lsquo;Oh! hee lieth down, and hell
beddeth with him; hee sleepeth, and hell and hee dreame together; hee
riseth, and hell goeth to the fields with him; hee goes to his garden,
there is hell.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The man goes to his table, O! hee dare not eat, hee
hath no right to the creature; to eat is sin and hell; so hell is in
every dish. To live is sinne, <i>hee would faine chuse strangling</i>; every
act of breathing is sin and hell. Hee goes to church, there is a dog as
great as a mountaine before his eye: Here be terrors.&rsquo; <i>Rutherford's
Christ Dying</i>, 1647, 4to, pp. 41, 42. Now, listen to the confessions of
two of the tortured victims of the doctrines enunciated by the clergy;
victims who, after undergoing ineffable agony, were more than once,
according to their own account, tempted to put an end to their lives.
&lsquo;The cloud lasted for two years and some months.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The arrows of the
Almighty did drink up my spirits; night and day his hand lay heavy upon
me, so that even my bodily moisture was turned into the drought of
summer. When I said sometimes that my couch would ease my complaint, I
was filled with tossings to the dawning of the day.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Amidst all my
downcastings, I had the roaring lion to grapple with, who likes well to
fish in muddy waters. He strongly suggested to me that I should not eat,
because I had no right to food; or if I ventured to do it, the enemy
assured me, that the wrath of God would go down with my morsel; and that
I had forfeited a right to the divine favour, and, therefore, had
nothing to do with any of God's creatures.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;However, so violent were
the temptations of the strong enemy, that I frequently forgot to eat my
bread, and durst not attempt it; and when, through the persuasion of my
wife, I at any time did it, the enemy through the day did buffet me in a
violent way, assuring me that the wrath of God had gone over with what I
had taken.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The enemy after all did so pursue me, that he violently
suggested to my soul, that, some time or other, God would suddenly
destroy me as with a thunderclap: which so filled my soul with fear and
pain, that, every now and then, I looked about me, to receive the divine
blow, still expecting it was a coming; yea, many a night I durst not
sleep, lest I had awakened in everlasting flames.&rsquo; <i>Stevenson's Rare
Cordial</i>, pp. 11&ndash;13. Another poor creature, after hearing one of
Smiton's sermons, in 1740, says, &lsquo;Now, I saw myself to be a condemned
criminal; but I knew not the day of my execution. I thought that there
was nothing between me and hell, but the brittle thread of natural
life.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;And in this dreadful confusion, I durst not sleep, lest I had
awakened in everlasting flames.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;And Satan violently assaulted me to
take away my own life, seeing there was no mercy for me.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Soon after
this, I was again violently assaulted by the tempter to take away my own
life; he presented to me a knife therewith to do it; no person being in
the house but myself. The enemy pursued me so close, that I could not
endure so much as to see the knife in my sight, but laid it away.&rsquo; &hellip;
&lsquo;One evening, as I was upon the street, Satan violently assaulted me to
go into the sea and drown myself; it would be the easiest death. Such a
fear of Satan then fell upon me, as made my joints to shake, so that it
was much for me to walk home; and when I came to the door, I found
nobody within; I was afraid to go into the house, lest Satan should get
power over me.&rsquo; <i>Memoirs of the Life and Experiences of Marion Laird of
Greenock</i>, pp. 13, 14, 19, 45, 223, 224.</p></div>

another; he can make the change of aire, and small insects do that worke
when he pleaseth.&rsquo; <i>Ibid.</i>, vol. i. p. 422. The same divine, in another
elaborate treatise, distinctly imputes to the Deity a sensation of
pleasure in injuring even the innocent. &lsquo;When God sends out a scourge,
of sword, famine, or pestilence, suddenly to overthrow and cut people
off, not only are the wicked reached thereby (which is here supposed),
but even the innocent, that is such as are righteous and free of gross
provocations; for, in any other sense, none are innocent, or free of
sin, in this life. Yea, further, in trying of the innocent by these
scourges, <i>the Lord seems to act as one delighted with it</i>, and little
resenting the great extremities wherewith they are pressed.&rsquo; <i>Hutcheson's
Exposition of the Book of Job</i>, 1669, folio, p. 123. Compare p. 359. &lsquo;It
pleaseth the Lord to exercise great variety in afflicting the children
of men,&rsquo; &amp;c. But, after all, mere extracts can give but a faint idea of
the dark and malignant spirit which pervades these writings.</p></div>

Moncrief, in his sermon next day, &lsquo;told us, &ldquo;That God's voice was crying

over the walls to us; that we should amend our ways, lest he should come

never have touched our skin.&rsquo; <i>Durham's Law Unsealed</i>, p. 160;

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_529_529" id="Footnote_529_529"></a><a href="#FNanchor_529_529"><span class="label">[529]</span></a> It was not until late in the eighteenth century, that the
Scotch clergy gave up this notion. At last, even they became influenced
by the ridicule to which their superstition exposed them, and which
produced more effect than any argument could have done. The doctrines,
however, which they and their predecessors had long inculcated, had so
corrupted the popular mind, that instances will, I believe, be found
even in the nineteenth century, of the Scotch deeming precautions
against small-pox to be criminal, or, as they called it, flying in the
face of Providence. The latest evidence I can at this moment put my hand
on, is in a volume published in 1797. It is stated by the Rev. John
Paterson, that, in the parish of Auldearn, in the county of Nairn, &lsquo;Very
few have fallen a sacrifice to the small-pox, though the people are in
general averse to inoculation, from the general gloominess of their
faith, which teaches them, that all diseases which afflict the human
frame are instances of the Divine interposition, for the punishment of
sin; any interference, therefore, on their part, they deem an usurpation
of the prerogative of the Almighty.&rsquo; <i>Sinclair's Statistical Account of
Scotland</i>, vol. xix. p. 618, Edinburgh, 1797. See also vol. xiv. p. 52,
Edinburgh, 1795. This is well said. No doubt, so abject, and so
pernicious, a superstition among the people, was the result of &lsquo;the
general gloominess of their faith.&rsquo; But the Rev. John Paterson has
forgotten to add, that the gloominess of which he complains, was in
strict conformity with the teachings of the most able, the most
energetic, and the most venerated of the Scotch clergy. Mr. Paterson
renders scant justice to his countrymen, and should rather have praised
the tenacity with which they adhered to the instructions they had long
been accustomed to receive.</p></div>

&lsquo;there is no time wherein men are more ready to miscarry, and discover
any bitter root in them, then when they are about
the liberal use of the creatures, and amidst occasions of mirth and
cheerfulness.&rsquo; How this doctrine ripened, cannot be better illustrated
than from the sentiments entertained, so late as the early part of the
eighteenth century, by Colonel Blackader, a Scotch officer, who was also
an educated man, who had seen much of the world, and might, to some
degree, be called a man of the world. In December 1714, he went to a
wedding, and, on his return home, he writes: &lsquo;I was cheerful, and
perhaps gave too great a swing to raillery, but I hope not light or vain
in conversation. I desire always to have my speech seasoned with salt,
and ministering profit to the hearers. Sitting up late, and merry
enough, though I hope innocent; but I will not justify myself.&rsquo; <i>The
Life and Diary of Lieut.-Col. J. Blackader, by Andrew Crichton</i>, p. 453.
On another occasion (p. 511), in 1720, he was at an evening party. &lsquo;The
young people were merry. I laid a restraint upon myself for fear of
going too far, and joined but little, only so as not to show moroseness
or ill-breeding. We sat late, but the conversation was innocent, and no
drinking but as we pleased. However, much time is spent; which I dare
not justify. <i>In all things we offend.</i>&rsquo; At p. 159, he writes, &lsquo;I should
always be mixing something that may edify in my discourse;&rsquo; and, says
his biographer (p. 437), &lsquo;Conversation, when it ceased to accomplish
this object, he regarded as <i>degenerating into idle entertainment</i>,
which ought to be checked rather than encouraged.&rsquo;</p></div>

unusual liberality, permits occasional laughter. He says, &lsquo;There is a
faculty of laughing given to men, which certainly is given for use, at
least at sometimes; and diversions are sometime needfull for men who are
serious and employed in weighty affairs.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;And particularly, laughter
is sometimes lawful for magistrates and others in publick charge, not
only that they may recreate themselves, but that, thereby, and by the
like insinuating carriage, they may gain the affection of the people.&rsquo;

preachers, I hesitate as to the propriety of quoting; but it is
essential that their ideas should be known, if the history of Scotland
is to be understood. Rutherford, after stating whom it is that we should
seek to imitate, adds: &lsquo;Christ did never laugh on earth that we read of,
but he wept.&rsquo; <i>Rutherford's Christ Dying</i>, 1647, 4to, p. 525. I publish

makes one good meal and has enough left for a second, is in imminent

&lsquo;men are loth to lend their eare to the Word, when they abound in

and be desirous of more than what is competent for the maintenance and
support of our lives, is both inconsistent with that dependence and
subjection we owe to God, and doth also bespeak a great deal of vanity,
folly, and inconsiderateness.&rsquo; Boston, striking at the very foundation
of that practice of providing for the future, which is the first and
most important maxim in all civil wisdom, and which peculiarly
distinguishes civilized nations from barbarians, asks his hearers, &lsquo;Why
should men rack their heads with cares how to provide for to-morrow,
while they know not if they shall then need anything?&rsquo; <i>Boston's Human
Nature in its Four-fold State</i>, p. 300. Hutcheson thinks that those who
are guilty of such impious prudence, deserve to be starved. &lsquo;When men
are not content with food and rayment, but would still heap up more, it
is just with God to leave them not so much as bread; and to suffer men
to have an evil eye upon them, and to pluck at them, even so long as
they have meat.&rsquo; <i>Hutcheson's Exposition of the Book of Job</i>, p. 296.
Binning, going still further, threatens eternal ruin. &lsquo;Ye may have
things necessary here,&mdash;food and raiment; and if ye seek more, if ye
will be rich, and will have superfluities, then ye shall fall into many
temptations, snares, and hurtful lusts which shall drown you in
perdition.&rsquo; <i>Binning's Sermons</i>, vol. iii. p. 355.</p></div>

so liberally, and heap them up upon some base covetous wretches? Surely
no.&rsquo; <i>Binning's Sermons</i>, vol. iii. p. 366. Gray, in his zeal against
wealth, propounds another doctrine, which I do not remember to have seen
elsewhere. He says, &lsquo;All that the owner of riches hath, is, the seeing
of them; which a man, who is a passer by, may likeways have, though he
be not possessor of them.&rsquo; <i>Gray's Spiritual Warfare</i>, p. 128. I hope

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">AN EXAMINATION OF THE SCOTCH INTELLECT DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</div>

<p>To complete the history and analysis of the Scotch
mind, I have now to examine the peculiar intellectual
movement which appeared in the eighteenth century,
and which, for several reasons, deserves careful
attention. It was essentially a reaction against that
theological spirit which predominated during the seventeenth
century. Such a reaction would hardly have been
possible, except for the fact which I have already noticed,
namely, that the political activity which produced the
rebellion against the Stuarts, saved the Scotch mind
from stagnating, and prevented that deep slumber into
which the progress of superstition would naturally have
thrown it. The long and stubborn conflict with a despotic
government, kept alive a certain alertness and
vigour of understanding, which survived the struggle
that gave it birth. When the contest was ended, and
peace was restored, the faculties which, for three generations,
had been exercised in resisting the executive
authority, sought other employment, and found another
field in which they could disport themselves. Hence it
was, that the boldness which, in the seventeenth century,
was practical, became, in the eighteenth century,
speculative, and produced a literature, which attempted
to unsettle former opinions, and to disturb the ancient
landmarks of the human mind. The movement was revolutionary,
and bore the same relation to ecclesiastical
tyranny, which the previous movement had borne to
political tyranny. But this new rebellion had one striking
characteristic. In nearly every other country, when
the intellect has fairly arrayed itself against the exclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
pretensions of the Church, it has happened that the
secular philosophy, which has been engendered, has been
an inductive philosophy, taking for its basis individual
and specific experience, and seeking, by that means, to
overthrow the general and traditional notions, on which
all church power is founded. The plan has been, to refuse
to accept principles which could not be substantiated
by facts; while the opposite and theological plan
is, to force the facts to yield to the principles. In the
former case, experience precedes theory; in the latter
case, theory precedes experience, and controls it. In
theology, certain principles are taken for granted; and,
it being deemed impious to question them, all that remains
for us is to reason from them downwards. This
is the deductive method. On the other hand, the inductive
method will concede nothing, but insists upon
reasoning upwards, and demands that we shall have the
liberty of ascertaining the principles for ourselves. In
a complete scheme of our knowledge, and when all our
resources are fully developed and marshalled into order,
as they must eventually be, the two methods will be,
not hostile, but supplementary, and will be combined
into a single system. At present, however, we are very
far from such a result; and not only is every mind more
prone to one method than to another, but we find, historically,
that different ages and different countries have
been characterised by the extent to which one of these
two schemes has predominated; and we also find,
that a study of this antagonism is the surest way of
understanding the intellectual condition of any period.</p>

<p>That the inductive philosophy is even more marked
by its secular tendencies than by its scientific ones, will
be evident to whoever observes the epochs in which it
has been most active, and has possessed most adherents.
Of this, the history of the French mind, in the eighteenth
century, affords a good instance, where, after the death
of Louis XIV., we may clearly trace the connexion between
the growth of the inductive method, and the subsequent
overthrow of the Gallican Church. In England,
too, the rise of the Baconian philosophy, with its determination
to subordinate ancient principles to modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
experience, was the heaviest blow which has ever been
inflicted on the theologians, whose method is to begin,
not with experience, but with principles, which are said
to be inscrutable, and which we are bound to believe
without further difficulty. And I need hardly remind
the reader, that scarcely was that philosophy established
among us, when it produced those bold inquiries which
quickly ended in the downfall of the English Church
under Charles I. From that terrible defeat, our clergy
did, for a time, partly rally; but as their apparent success,
in the reign of Charles II., was owing to political
changes, and not to social ones, they were unable to recover
their hold over society, and, unless the nation
should retrograde, there is no possibility that they ever
should recover it. Over the inferior order of minds, they
still wield great influence; but the Baconian philosophy,
by bringing their favourite method into disrepute, has
sapped the very base of their system. From the moment
that their mode of investigation was discredited,
the secret of their power was gone. From the moment
that men began to insist on inquiring into the validity
of first principles, instead of accepting them without
inquiry, and humbly submitting to them as matters of
faith and of necessary belief; from that moment, the
theologians, driven from one post to another, and constantly
receding before the pressure of advancing knowledge,
have been forced to abandon entrenchment after
entrenchment, until what they have retained of their
former territory is hardly worth the struggle. As a last
resource, they, at the close of the eighteenth century,
determined to use the weapons of their opponents; and
Paley and his successors, enlarging the scheme which
Ray and Derham had feebly sketched, endeavoured, by
a skilful employment of the inductive method, to compensate
their party for the failure of the deductive one.
But their project, though ably conceived, has come to
naught. It is now generally admitted, that nothing can
be made of it, and that it is impossible to establish the
old theological premises by a chain of inductive reasoning.
Respecting this, the most eminent philosophers
agree with the most eminent theologians; and, since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
time of Kant in Germany, and of Coleridge in England,
none of our ablest men, even among divines themselves,
have recurred to a plan which Paley, indeed, pursued
with vigour, but of which our Bridgewater Treatises,
our Prize-Essays, and such schoolboy productions, are
poor and barren imitations.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> No great thinkers now
follow this course in matters of religion. On the contrary,
they prefer the safer, as well as the more philosophic,
method, of dealing with these subjects on transcendental
grounds, frankly confessing that they elude the
grasp of that inductive philosophy which, in the department
of science, has achieved such signal triumphs.</p>

<p>The opposition of these two methods, and the inapplicability
of the inductive method to theological pursuits
being thus apparent, it is not strange that the
Scotch should have adopted one of the methods with
great zeal, and to the almost complete exclusion of the
other. Scotland, being essentially theological, followed
the theological plan. The intellectual history of
that country, in the seventeenth century, is almost
entirely the history of theology. With the single
exception of Napier, who was born in the middle of
the sixteenth century, all the most vigorous thinkers
were divines. In physical science, scarcely anything
was done.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> There was no poetry, no drama, no original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
philosophy, no fine compositions, no secular literature,
now worth reading.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> The only men of real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
influence were the clergy. They governed the nation
and the pulpit was the chief engine of their power.
From the pulpit, they moved all classes and all sorts
intellects; the highest as well as the lowest. There, they
instructed them, and threatened them; saying whatever
they liked, and knowing that what they said would
be believed.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> But all their sermons, and all their controversial
writings, are eminently deductive; not
of them attempts an inductive argument. The
idea of such a thing never entered their heads. They
assumed the truth of their own religion and moral
notions, most of which they had borrowed from
antiquity; they made those notions the major premises
of their syllogisms, and from them they reasoned downwards
till they obtained their conclusions. They never
suspected that premises, taken from ancient times
might be the result of the inductions of those times
and that, as knowledge advanced, the inductions might
need revising. They assumed, that God has given
us first principles, and that He, having revealed them
it would ill become us to scrutinize them. That He
had revealed them, they took for granted, and deemed
it unnecessary to prove.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> Their method being
entirely deductive, all they were concerned with was
to beware that no error crept in between the premises
and the conclusions. And this part of their task they
accomplished with great ability. They were acute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
dialecticians, and rarely blundered in what is termed
the formal part of logic. In dealing with their premises
after they obtained them, they were extremely
skilful; how they obtained them, they were very heedless.
That was a point they never examined with
anything approaching to impartiality. According to
their method, all that was requisite was, to draw inferences
from what had been supernaturally communicated.
On the other hand, the inductive method would have
taught them that the first question was, whether or not
they had been supernaturally communicated? They,
as deductive reasoners, assumed the very preliminaries
which inductive reasoners would have disputed. They
proceeded from generals to particulars, instead of from
particulars to generals. And they would not allow
either themselves or others to sift the general propositions,
which were to cover and control the particular
facts. It was enough for them that the wider propositions
were already established, and were to be treated
according to the rules of the old and syllogistic logic.
Indeed, they were so convinced of the impropriety of
the inductive method, that they did not hesitate to
assert, that it was by means of the syllogism that the
Deity communicated His wishes to man.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>It was naturally to be expected, that the clergy,
holding these views respecting the best means of arriving
at truth, should do all in their power to bring
over the nation to their side, and should labour to make
their own method of investigation entirely supersede
the opposite method. Nor was this a very difficult task.
The prevailing credulity was one great point in their
favour, inasmuch as it made men more willing to
accept propositions than to scrutinise them. When the
propositions were accepted, nothing was left but to
reason from them; and the most active intellects in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Scotland, being constantly engaged in this process,
acquired complete mastery over it, and the dexterity
they displayed increased its repute. Besides this, the
clergy, who were its zealous champions, had monopolized
all the sources of education, both public and
private. In no other Protestant country, have they
exercised such control over the universities; not only
the doctrines taught, but also the mode of teaching
them, being, in Scotland, placed under the supervision
of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> This power they, of course, used to
propagate their own plan of obtaining truth; and, as
long as their power remained undiminished, it was
hardly possible that the opposite, or inductive, plan
should gain a hearing. Over grammar-schools, the
clergy possessed an authority fully equal to that which
they had in the universities.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> They also appointed and
removed, at their own pleasure, teachers of every grade,
from village schoolmasters to tutors in private families.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
In this way, each generation, as it arose, was brought
under their influence, and made subject to their notions.
Taking the mind of Scotland while it was young and
flexible, they bent it to their own method. Hence,
that method became supreme; it reigned every where;
not a voice was lifted up against it; and no one had an
idea that there was more than one path by which truth
could be reached, or that the human understanding
was of any use, except to deal deductively with premisses,
which were not to be inductively examined.</p>

<p>The inductive or analytic spirit being thus unknown,
and the deductive or synthetic spirit being alone
favoured, it happened that, when, early in the eighteenth
century, the circumstances already mentioned gave
rise to a great intellectual movement, that movement,
though new in its results, was not new in the method
by which the results were obtained. A secular philosophy
was, indeed, established, and the ablest men,
instead of being theological, became scientific. But so
completely had the theological plan occupied Scotland,
that even philosophers were unable to escape from its
method, and, as I am about to show, the inductive
method exercised no influence over them. This most
curious fact is the key to the history of Scotland in the
eighteenth century, and explains many events which
would otherwise appear incompatible with each other.
It also suggests an analogy with Germany, where the
deductive method has, for a long period, been equally
prevalent, owing to precisely the same causes. In both
countries, the secular movement of the eighteenth
century was unable to become inductive; and this intellectual
affinity between two such otherwise different
nations, is, I have no doubt, the principal reason why
the Scotch and German philosophies have so remarkably
acted and reacted upon each other; Kant and
Hamilton being the most finished specimens of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
intercourse. To this, England forms a complete contrast.
For more than a hundred and fifty years after
the death of Bacon, the greatest English thinkers,
Newton and Harvey excepted, were eminently inductive;
nor was it until the nineteenth century that
signs were clearly exhibited of a counter-movement,
and an attempt was made to return in some degree to
the deductive method.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> This we are, in many respects,
justified in doing, because, in the progress of our knowledge,
we have, by a long course of induction, arrived
at several conclusions which we may safely treat deductively;
that is to say, we may make them the
major premisses of new arguments. The same process
has been seen in France, where the exclusively
inductive philosophy of the eighteenth century preceded
a partial resuscitation of deductive philosophy in
the nineteenth century. In Scotland, however, there
have been no such vicissitudes. In that country, men
have always been deductive; even the most original
thinkers being unable to liberate themselves from the
universal tendency, and being forced to accept a method
which time had consecrated, and which was interwoven
with all the associations of the national mind.</p>

<p>To understand the investigation into which we are
about to enter, the reader must firmly seize, and keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
before his eyes, the essential difference between deduction,
which reasons from principles, and induction, which
reasons to principles. He must remember, that induction
proceeds from the smaller to the greater; deduction, from
the greater to the smaller. Induction is from particulars
to generals, and from the senses to the ideas; deduction
is from generals to particulars, and from the ideas to the
senses. By induction, we rise from the concrete to the
abstract; by deduction, we descend from the abstract to
the concrete. Accompanying this distinction, there are
certain qualities of mind, which, with extremely few
exceptions, characterize the age, nation, or individual,
in which one of these methods is predominant. The
inductive philosopher is naturally cautious, patient, and
somewhat creeping; while the deductive philosopher is
more remarkable for boldness, dexterity, and often rashness.
The deductive thinker invariably assumes certain
premisses, which are quite different from the hypotheses
essential to the best induction. These premisses are sometimes
borrowed from antiquity; sometimes they are taken
from the notions which happen to prevail in the surrounding
society; sometimes they are the result of a
man's own peculiar organization; and sometimes, as we
shall presently see, they are deliberately invented, with
the object of arriving, not at truth, but at an approximation
to truth. Finally, and to sum up the whole, we
may say that a deductive habit, being essentially synthetic,
always tends to multiply original principles or
laws; while the tendency of an inductive habit is to
diminish those laws by gradual and successive analysis.</p>

<p>These being the two fundamental divisions of human
inquiry, it is surely a most remarkable fact in the history
of Scotland, that, during the eighteenth century, all the
great thinkers belonged to the former division, and that,
in the very few instances of induction which their works
contain, it is evident, from the steps they subsequently
took, that they regarded such inductions as unimportant
in themselves, and as only valuable in so far as they
supplied the premisses for another and deductive investigation.
As the various departments of our knowledge
have never yet been co-ordinated and treated as a whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
probably no one is aware of the universality of this
movement in Scotland, and of the extent to which it
pervaded every science, and governed every phase of
thought. To prove, therefore, the force with which it
acted, I now purpose to examine its working in all the
principal forms of speculation, whether physical or moral,
and to show that in each the same method was adopted.
In doing this, I must, for the sake of clearness, proceed
according to a natural arrangement of the different
topics; but I will, whenever it is possible, also follow
the chronological order in which the Scotch mind unfolded
itself; so that we may understand, not only the
character of that remarkable literature, but likewise the
steps of its growth, and the astonishing vigour with
which it emancipated itself from the shackles which
superstition had imposed.</p>

<p>The beginning of the great secular philosophy of
Scotland is undoubtedly due to Francis Hutcheson.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
This eminent man, though born in Ireland, was of
Scotch family, and was educated in the University of
Glasgow, where he received the appointment of Professor
of Philosophy in the year 1729.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> By his lectures,
and by his works, he diffused a taste for bold inquiries
into subjects of the deepest importance, but concerning
which it had previously been supposed nothing fresh was
to be learned; the Scotch having hitherto been taught,
that all truths respecting our own nature, which were
essential to be known, had been already revealed. Hutcheson,
however, did not fear to construct a system of
morals according to a plan entirely secular, and no example
of which had been exhibited in Scotland before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
his time. The principles from which he started, were
not theological, but metaphysical. They were collected
from what he deemed the natural constitution of the
mind, instead of being collected, as heretofore, from what
had been supernaturally communicated. He, therefore,
shifted the field of study. Though he was a firm believer
in revelation, he held that the best rules of conduct
could be ascertained without its assistance, and could be
arrived at by the unaided wit of man; and that, when
arrived at, they were, in their aggregate, to be respected
as the Law of Nature.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> This confidence in the power
of the human understanding was altogether new in Scotland,
and its appearance forms an epoch in the national
literature. Previously, men had been taught that the
understanding was a rash and foolish thing, which ought
to be repressed, and which was unfit to cope with the
problems presented to it.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Hutcheson, however, held
that it was quite able to deal with them, but that, to do
so, it must be free and unfettered. Hence, he strenuously
advocated that right of private judgment which
the Scotch Kirk had not only assailed, but had almost
destroyed. He insisted that each person had a right to
form his opinion according to the evidence he possessed,
and that, this right being inalienable, none but weak
minds would abstain from exercising it.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
was to judge according to his own light, and nothing
could be gained by inducing men to profess sentiments
contrary to their convictions.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> So far, however, was
this from being understood, that we found all the little
sects quarrelling among themselves, and abusing each
other, merely because their views were different. It was
strange to hear how the professors of one creed would
stigmatize the professors of other creeds as idolatrous,
and would demand that penalties should be inflicted on
them. In point of fact, all had much that was good;
and their only real evil was, this love of persecution.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>
But the vulgar deemed every one a heretic who did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
believe what they believed; and this way of thinking
had been too much countenanced by the clergy, many of
whom felt their vanity offended at the idea of laymen
pretending to be wiser than their spiritual teachers, and
venturing to disagree with what they said.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>Such large views of liberty were far in advance of
the country in which they were propounded, and could
exercise no influence, except over a few thinking men.
These, and similar doctrines, were, however, repeated by
Hutcheson, in his lectures, every year.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> And strange,
indeed, they must have seemed. To those who received
them, they were utterly subversive of the prevailing
theological spirit, which regarded toleration as impious,
and which, seeking to confine the human mind within
the limits of foregone conclusions, deemed it a duty to
chastise those who overstepped them. In opposition to
this, Hutcheson let in the elements of inquiry, of discussion,
and of doubt. There is also another point in which
his philosophy is memorable, as the beginning of the
great rebellion of the Scotch intellect. We saw, in the
last chapter, how successfully the teachers of the people
had inculcated doctrines of the darkest asceticism, and
how naturally those doctrines had arisen out of the enormous
authority possessed by the Church. Against such
notions, Hutcheson set his face strenuously. He rightly
supposed, that an admiration of every kind of beauty,
so far from being sinful, is essential to a complete and
well-balanced mind; and the most original part of his
philosophy consists of the inquiries which he made into
the working and origin of our ideas on that subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Hitherto, the Scotch had been taught that the emotions
which beauty excites, were owing to the corruption of
our nature, and ought to be repressed. Hutcheson, on the
other hand, insisted that they were good in themselves;
that they were part of the general scheme of human
affairs, and that they deserved a special and scientific
study.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> And with such skill did he investigate them,
that, in the opinion of one of the highest living authorities,
he is the originator of all subsequent inquiries into
these matters; his being the first attempt to deal with
the subject of beauty in a broad and comprehensive
spirit.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<p>Not only in speculative views, but also in practical
recommendations, Hutcheson displayed the same tendency;
every where endeavouring to break down that
gloomy fabric which superstition had built up.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
predecessors, and, indeed, nearly all his contemporaries
who exercised much influence, represented pleasure as
immoral, and opposed themselves to the fine arts, which
they considered dangerous, as ministering to our pleasures,
and thereby distracting our minds from serious
concerns. Hutcheson, however, declared that the fine
arts were to be cherished; for, he said, they are not only
agreeable, but also reputable, and to employ our time
with them is honourable.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> That such is the case is
obvious enough to us, but it was long, indeed, since
similar language had been heard in Scotland from a great
public teacher, and it was completely opposed to the
prevailing notions. But Hutcheson went even further.
Not content with raising his voice in favour of wealth,<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
which the Scotch clergy stigmatized as one of the most
pernicious and carnal of all things, he fearlessly asserted
that all our natural appetites are lawful, and that the
gratification of them is consistent with the highest
virtue.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> In his eyes, they were lawful, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
were natural; while, according to the theological theory,
their being natural made them unlawful. And here lies
the fundamental difference between the practical views
of Hutcheson and those previously received. He, like
every great thinker since the seventeenth century, loved
human nature, and respected it; but he neither loved nor
respected those who unduly trammelled it, and thereby
weakened its vigour, as well as impaired its beauty. He
placed more confidence in mankind, than in the rulers of
mankind. The Scotch divines, who preceded him, were
the libellers of their species; they calumniated the whole
human race. According to them, there was nothing in
us but sin and corruption; and, therefore, all our desires
were to be checked. It is the peculiar glory of Hutcheson,
that he was the first man in Scotland who publicly
combated these degrading notions. With a noble and
lofty aim did he undertake his task. Venerating the
human mind, he was bent on vindicating its dignity
against those who disputed its titles. Unhappily, he
could not succeed; the prejudices of his time were
too strong. Still, he did all that was in his power.
He opposed the tide which he was unable to stem; he
attacked what it was impossible to destroy; and he cast
from his philosophy, with vehement scorn, those base
prejudices, which, by aspersing all that is great and
magnanimous, had long blinded the eyes of their contemporaries,
and, by bringing into fresh prominence the
old and mischievous dogma of moral degeneracy, had
represented our nature as a compound of vices, and had
been unable to see how many virtues we really possess,
how much of the spirit of self-sacrifice, and of free disinterested
benevolence has always existed; how much of
good even the worst of us retain; and how, among the
ordinary and average characters of whom the world is
composed, the desire of benefiting others is more frequent
than the desire of hurting them, kindness is more
common than cruelty, and the number of good deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
does, on the whole, far outweigh the number of bad
ones.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>Thus much as to the tendency of Hutcheson's philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
We have now to ascertain his method, that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to say, the plan which he adopted in order to obtain his
results. This is a very important part of our present
inquiry; and we shall find that, in the study of moral
philosophy, as in the study of all subjects not yet raised
to sciences, there are not only two methods, but that each
method leads to different consequences. If we proceed
by induction, we arrive at one conclusion; if we proceed
by deduction, we arrive at another. This difference in
the results, is always a proof that the subject, in which
the difference exists, is not yet capable of scientific treatment,
and that some preliminary difficulties have to be
removed, before it can pass from the empirical stage
into the scientific one. As soon as those difficulties are
got rid of, the results obtained by induction, will correspond
with those obtained by deduction; supposing, of
course, that both lines of argument are fairly managed.
In such case, it will be of no importance whether we
reason from particulars to generals, or from generals to
particulars. Either plan will yield the same consequences,
and this agreement between the consequences, proves
that our investigation is, properly speaking, scientific.
Thus, for instance, in chemistry, if, by reasoning deductively
from general principles, we could always predict
what would happen when we united two or more elements,
even supposing those elements were new to us;
and if, by reasoning inductively from each element, we
could arrive at the same conclusion, one process would
corroborate the other, and, by their mutual verification,
the science would be complete. In chemistry, we cannot
do this; therefore, chemistry is not yet a science,
although, since the introduction into it, by Dalton, of the
ideas of weight and number, there is every prospect of
its becoming one. On the other hand, astronomy is a
science, because, by employing the deductive weapon of
mathematics, we can compute the motions and perturbations
of bodies; and, by employing the inductive weapon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of observation, the telescope reveals to us the accuracy
of our previous, and, as it were, foregone, inferences.
The fact agrees with the idea; the particular event confirms
the general principle; the principle explains the
event; and their unanimity authorizes us to believe that
we must be right, since, proceed as we may, the conclusion
is the same; and the inductive plan, of striking
averages, harmonizes with the deductive plan, of
reasoning from ideas.</p>

<p>But, in the study of morals there is no such harmony.
Partly from the force of prejudice, and partly from the
complexity of the subject, all attempts at a scientific
investigation of morals have failed. It is not, therefore,
surprising that, in this field, the inductive inquirer arrives
at one conclusion, and the deductive inquirer at
another. The inductive inquirer endeavours to attain his
object by observing the actions of men, and subjecting
them to analysis, in order to learn the principles which
regulate them. The deductive inquirer, beginning at
the other end, assumes certain principles as original,
and reasons from them to the facts which actually appear
in the world. The former proceeds from the concrete to
the abstract; the latter, from the abstract to the concrete.
The inductive moralist looks at the history of
past society, or at the condition of the present, and takes
for granted that the first step is, to assemble the facts,
and then to generalize them. The deductive inquirer,
using the facts rather to illustrate his principles, than to
suggest them, appeals, in the first place, not to external
facts, but to internal ideas, and he makes those ideas the
major premiss of a syllogistic argument. Both parties
agree, that we have the power of judging some actions
to be right, and others to be wrong. But as to how we
get that power, and as to what that power is, they are
at utter variance. The inductive philosopher says, that
its object is happiness, that we get it by association, and
that it is due to the action and reaction of social causes,
which are susceptible of analysis. The deductive philosopher
says, that this power of distinguishing between
right and wrong, aims, not at happiness, but at truth;
that it is inherent, that it cannot be analyzed, that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
a primary conviction, and that we may assume it and
reason from it, but can never hope to explain it by
reasoning to it.</p>

<p>It requires but a slight acquaintance with the works
of Hutcheson to see that he belongs to the latter of these
two schools. He assumes, that all men have what he
terms a moral faculty, which, being an original principle,
does not admit of analysis.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> He further assumes, that
the business of this faculty is to regulate all our powers.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
From these two assumptions, he reasons downwards to
the visible facts of our conduct, and deductively constructs
the general scheme of life. His plan being entirely synthetic,
he depreciates the analytic method, and complains
of it as an artful attempt to diminish the number of our
perceptive powers.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> The truth is, that every such
diminution would have taken away some of his original
principles, and would thereby have prevented him from
using them as the major premisses of separate arguments.
And if you deprive a deductive reasoner of his major
premisses, you leave him nothing on which to stand.
Hutcheson, therefore, like all the philosophers of his
school, was extremely jealous of the invasions of the inductive
spirit, with its constant tendency to attack convictions
supposed to be primary, and seek to resolve
them into their elements. He repulsed such encroachments
upon his major premisses, because the power and
beauty of his method were displayed in reasoning from
the premisses, and not in reasoning to them. According
to him, the moral faculty, and the authority which it
exercised, were impervious to analysis; it was impossible
to track them higher, or to resolve them into simpler
constituents; and it was in vain that many attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
to refer them to circumstances external to themselves,
such as education, custom, or the association of ideas.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>Hence, the judgments which men pass upon the
conduct of others, or of themselves, are, in their origin,
altogether inexplicable; each judgment being merely a
different form of one great moral faculty. Inasmuch,
however, as that faculty escapes observation, and is only
known by its results, it is evident that, for all purposes
of reasoning, the judgments must be deemed primary,
and arguments are to be constructed from them, as if
they were the ultimate and highest conditions of our
nature. In this way, Hutcheson was led to that love of
multiplying original principles, which Sir James Mackintosh
has justly noticed as a characteristic of his
philosophy, and, after him, of the Scotch philosophy in
general;<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> though the distinguished author of this
remark has failed to perceive that such characteristic
was but a single part of a far larger scheme, and was
intimately connected with those habits of deductive
thought which a long train of preceding circumstances
had indelibly imprinted on the Scotch mind.</p>

<p>In Hutcheson, the tendency was so strong, as to make
him believe, that, by arguing from a certain number of
original principles, he could construct the theory and
explain the march of human affairs, with little or no
aid from the experience of the past, or, indeed, of the
present. His views, for instance, respecting the nature
and objects of legislation, criminal, as well as civil, might
have been written by a recluse who had never quitted
his hermitage, and whose purity was still unsoiled by
the realities of the world. Starting from the so-called
nature of things, his first steps were ideal, and from them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
he sought to advance to the actual. In his account of
the duties of life, as they existed before the power of
government was consolidated, he quotes no evidence to
show what really happened among barbarous tribes who
were in that state; but he contents himself with deductive
inferences from the principles he had previously
laid down.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> Difficult questions relating to the laws of
property, are treated in the same manner; that is to say,
the conclusions respecting them are arrived at on speculative
grounds, and not by comparing how the different
enactments have worked in different countries.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Experience
is either shut out, or made subordinate to
theory; and facts are adduced to illustrate the inference,
but not to suggest it. So, too, the proper relation between
the people and their rulers, and the amount of
liberty which the people should possess, instead of being
inductively generalized from an historical inquiry into
the circumstances which had produced most happiness,
might, in the opinion of Hutcheson, be ascertained by
reasoning from the nature of government, and from the
ends for which it was instituted.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>The next great attempt to study the actions of men
scientifically, and to generalize the principles of their
conduct without the intervention of supernatural ideas,
was made by Adam Smith, who, in 1759, published his
<i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>, and, in 1776, his <i>Wealth
of Nations</i>. To understand the philosophy of this, by
far the greatest of all the Scotch thinkers, both works
must be taken together, and considered as one; since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
they are, in reality, the two divisions of a single subject.
In the <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, he investigates the sympathetic
part of human nature; in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>,
he investigates its selfish part. And as all of us are
sympathetic as well as selfish; in other words, as all of
us look without as well as within, and as this classification
is a primary and exhaustive division of our motives
to action, it is evident, that if Adam Smith had completely
accomplished his vast design, he would at once
have raised the study of human nature to a science,
leaving nothing for subsequent inquirers except to ascertain
the minor springs of affairs, all of which would
find their place in this general scheme, and be deemed
subordinate to it. In his attempt to perform this prodigious
task, and to traverse the enormous field which
he saw lying before him, he soon perceived that an inductive
investigation was impossible, because it would
require the labour of many lives even to assemble the
materials from which the generalization was to be made.
Moved by this reflection, and, probably, moved still
more by the intellectual habits which prevailed around
him, he resolved on adopting the deductive method instead
of the inductive; but, in seeking for the premisses
from which he was to reason, and on which his structure
was to be built, he resorted to a peculiar artifice,
which is perfectly valid, and which he had an undoubted
right to employ, though, to make it available, requires
such delicate tact, and involves so many refinements,
that extremely few writers have used it with effect on
social questions either before or since.</p>

<p>The plan to which I allude is, that when any subject
becomes unmanageable by the inductive method, whether
from the impossibility of experimenting upon it, or
from its extreme natural complexity, or from the presence
of immense and bewildering details collected
around it, we may, in all such cases, make an imaginary
separation of inseparable facts; and reason upon trains
of events which have no real and independent existence,
and which are nowhere to be found except in the mind
of the inquirer. A result obtained in this way, cannot
be strictly true; but, if we have reasoned accurately, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
will be as near truth as were the premisses from which
we started. To make it perfectly true, we must confront
it with other results, which we have arrived at
in a similar way, and from the same subject. These
separate inferences may eventually be coördinated into
a single system; so that, while each inference contains
only an imperfect truth, the whole of the inferences,
when put together, will contain perfect truth.</p>

<p>Such hypothetical arguments are evidently based
upon an intentional suppression of facts; and the artifice
is necessary, because, without the suppression, the
facts would be unmanageable. Each argument leads
to a conclusion which approximates to truth; hence,
whenever the premisses are so comprehensive as almost
to exhaust the facts to which they refer, the conclusion
will be so near to complete truth as to be of
the greatest value, even before it is coördinated with
other conclusions drawn from the same department of
inquiry.</p>

<p>Geometry exhibits the most perfect example of this
logical stratagem. The object of the geometrician is,
to generalize the laws of space; in other words, to ascertain
the necessary and universal relations of its various
parts. Inasmuch, however, as space would have no
parts unless it were divided, the geometrician is forced
to assume such a division; and he takes the simplest
possible form of it, a division by lines. Now, a line
considered as a fact, that is, as it is found in the actual
world, must always have two qualities, length and
breadth. However slight these qualities may be, every
line has them both. But if the geometrician took both
into consideration, he would find himself in the presence
of a problem too complicated for the resources of the
human understanding to deal with; or, at all events,
too complicated for the present resources of our knowledge.
He, therefore, by a scientific artifice, deliberately
strikes off one of these qualities, and asserts that
a line is length without breadth. He knows that the
assertion is false, but he also knows that it is necessary.
For, if you deny it, he can prove nothing. If you
insist upon his letting into his premisses the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
breadth, he is unable to proceed, and the whole fabric
of geometry falls to the ground. Since, however, the
breadth of the faintest line is so slight as to be incapable
of measurement, except by an instrument used under
the microscope, it follows that the assumption, that
there can be lines without breadth, is so nearly true,
that our senses, when unassisted by art, cannot detect
the error. Formerly, and until the invention of the
micrometer, in the seventeenth century, it was impossible
to detect it at all. Hence, the conclusions of the
geometrician approximate so close to truth, that we are
justified in accepting them as true. The flaw is too
minute to be perceived. But that there is a flaw, appears
to me certain. It appears certain, that whenever
something is kept back in the premisses, something
must be wanting in the conclusion. In all such cases,
the field of inquiry has not been entirely covered; and
part of the preliminary facts being suppressed, it must,
I think, be admitted, that complete truth is unattainable,
and that no problem in geometry has yet been
exhaustively solved.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>Still, the amazing triumphs effected in this branch of
mathematics, show how powerful a weapon that form
of deduction is, which proceeds by an artificial separation
of facts, in themselves inseparable. So little, however,
is the philosophy of the method understood, that
when, late in the eighteenth century, political economy
assumed a scientific form, many persons, who were
otherwise well instructed, reproached its cultivators
with their hard-heartedness; such objectors being unable
to see, that the science could not be constructed if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
it were necessary to take in the whole range of generous
and benevolent affections. The political economist aims
at discovering the laws of wealth, which are far too
complicated to be studied under every aspect. He,
therefore, selects one of those aspects, and generalizes
the laws as they are exhibited in the selfish parts of
human nature. And he is right in doing so, simply
because men, in the pursuit of wealth, consider their
own gratification oftener than the gratification of others.
Hence, he, like the geometrician, blots out one part of
his premisses, in order that he may manipulate the
remaining part with greater ease. But we must always
remember, that political economy, though a profound
and beautiful science, is only a science of one department
of life, and is founded upon a suppression of some
of the facts in which all large societies abound. It
suppresses, or, what comes to the same thing, it ignores,
many high and magnanimous feelings which we could
ill afford to lose. We are not, therefore, to allow its
conclusions to override all other conclusions. We may
accept them in science, and yet reject them in practice.
Thus, the political economist, when confining himself to
his own department, says, with good reason, that it is
both absurd and mischievous for government to undertake
to supply the working-classes with employment.
This assertion, he, as a political economist, can prove;
and yet, notwithstanding its scientific truth, it may
be practically right for a government to do the exact
opposite. It may be right for a government to supply
the employment, when the people are so ignorant as to
demand it, and when, at the same time, they are so
powerful as to plunge the country into anarchy if the
demand is refused. Here, the view of the politician
takes in all the premisses of which the political economist
had only taken in a portion. In the same way, as
a matter of economic science, it is wrong for any one to
relieve the poor; since nothing is better established,
than that to relieve poverty increases it, by encouraging
improvidence. But, in spite of this, the antagonistic
principle of sympathy will come into play, and will, in
some minds, operate with such force, as to make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
advisable, that he who feels it should give alms, because,
if he abstains from giving them, the violence which he
does to his own nature may inflict more mischief on
himself, than his bestowal of charity would inflict on
the general interests of society.</p>

<p>It will not, I hope, be considered that, in these remarks,
I have digressed from the main argument of the
present chapter, since, although, in making them, I have
aimed at clearing up a general question respecting the
nature of scientific proof, I have only done so with the
more particular object of illustrating the philosophy of
Adam Smith, and of explaining the method which that
most profound and original thinker pursued. We shall
now be able to see how entirely his plan was deductive,
and what a peculiar form of deduction it was. In his
two great works, he first lays down certain ideas, and
from them he marches on to the facts of the external
world. And, in each work, he reasons from only
part of his premisses; supplying the other part in the
other work. None of us are exclusively selfish, and
none of us are exclusively sympathetic. But Adam
Smith separates in speculation qualities which are inseparable
in reality. In his <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, he ascribes
our actions to sympathy; in his <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, he
ascribes them to selfishness. A short view of these two
works will prove the existence of this fundamental difference,
and will enable us to perceive that each is supplementary
to the other; so that, in order to understand
either, it is necessary to study both.</p>

<p>In the <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>, Adam Smith lays
down one great principle from which he reasons, and
to which all the others are subordinate. This principle
is, that the rules which we prescribe to ourselves, and
which govern our conduct, are solely arrived at by
observing the conduct of others.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> We judge ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
because we had previously judged them. Our notions
are obtained from without, and not from within. If,
therefore, we lived entirely alone, we could have no idea
of merit or demerit, and it would be impossible for us
to form an opinion as to whether our sentiments were
right or wrong.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> To acquire this knowledge, we must
look abroad. Inasmuch, however, as we have no direct
experience of what other persons actually feel, we can
only gain the information by conceiving what we should
feel if we were in their place.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> Hence, all men are,
in imagination, constantly changing situations with
others; and though the change is ideal, and lasts but
for a moment, it is the foundation of that great and
universal impulse which is called Sympathy.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p>By proceeding from these premisses, a vast number
of social phenomena may be explained. We naturally
sympathize with joy more than with sorrow.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Hence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that admiration for prosperous and successful persons,
which is quite independent of any benefit we expect
from them; and hence, too, the existence of different
ranks and of social distinctions, all of which emanate
from the same source.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> Hence, also, the feeling of
loyalty, which is a product, not of reason, nor of fear,
nor of a sense of public convenience, but rather of sympathy
with those above us, begetting an extraordinary
compassion for even their ordinary sufferings.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> Custom
and fashion play a great part in the world, but they
owe their origin entirely to sympathy;<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and so do the
various systems of philosophy which have flourished at
different times, the disagreement between which depends
on the fact, that each philosopher has sympathized with
different ideas, some sympathizing with the notion of
fitness or congruity, some with that of prudence, some
with that of benevolence, and every one developing the
conception paramount in his own mind.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> To sympathy,
again, we must ascribe the establishment of
rewards and punishments, and the whole of our criminal
laws, none of which would have existed but for our disposition
to sympathize with those who either do good
or suffer harm; for the circumstance of society being
protected by penal laws, is a subsequent and subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
discovery, which confirms our sense of their propriety,
but did not suggest it.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> The same principle causes
the difference of character exhibited by different classes,
such as the irritability of poets, compared with the
coolness of mathematicians;<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> it likewise causes that
social difference between the sexes, which makes men
more remarkable for generosity, and women for humanity.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
All these results illustrate the workings of
sympathy, and are the remote, but still the direct,
operations of that principle. Indeed, we can trace to it
some of the minutest divisions of character; pride and
vanity, for instance, being dependent on it, although
those two passions are often confused together, and are
sometimes strangely blended in the same mind.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p>Sympathy, then, is the main-spring of human conduct.
It arises, not so much from witnessing the passions
of other persons, as from witnessing the situation
which excites those passions.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> To this single process
we are indebted, not only for the highest principles, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
also for the deepest emotions. For, the greatest affection
of which we are capable, is merely sympathy fixed
into habit; and the love which exists between the nearest
relations, is not inherent, but is derived from this
mighty and controlling principle, which governs the
whole course of affairs.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>By this bold hypothesis, Adam Smith, at one stroke,
so narrowed the field of inquiry, as to exclude from it
all considerations of selfishness as a primary principle,
and only to admit its great antagonist, sympathy. The
existence of the antagonism, he distinctly recognizes.
For, he will not allow that sympathy is in any way to
be deemed a selfish principle.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Although he knew that
it is pleasurable, and that all pleasure contains an element
of selfishness, it did not suit the method of his
philosophy to subject the principle of sympathy to such
an inductive analysis as would reveal its elements. His
business was, to reason from it, and not to it. Concentrating
his energy upon the deductive process, and
displaying that dialectic skill which is natural to his
countrymen, and of which he himself was one of the
most consummate masters the world has ever seen, he
constructed a system of philosophy, imperfect indeed,
because the premisses were imperfect, but approaching
truth as closely as it was possible for any one to do who
abstained from giving due consideration to the selfish
part of human nature. Into the workings of its sympathetic
part, he looked with a minuteness, and he
reasoned from it with a subtlety, which make his work
the most important that has ever been written on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
interesting subject. But, inasmuch as his plan involved
a deliberate suppression of preliminary and essential
facts, the results which he obtained do not strictly correspond
to those which are actually observed in the
world.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> This, however, as I have shown, is not a valid
objection; since such discrepancy between the ideal and
the actual, or between the abstract and the concrete, is
the necessary consequence of that still early condition
of our knowledge, which forces us to study complicated
questions piecemeal, and to raise them to sciences by
separate and fragmentary investigations.</p>

<p>That Adam Smith saw this necessity, and that his
seeing it was the cause of the method he pursued, is
evident from the fact, that in his next great work he
followed the same plan, and, though he argued from
new premisses, he carefully avoided arguing from any
of the old ones. Convinced that, in his theory of morals,
he had reasoned as accurately as possible from the
principles supplied by sympathy, his capacious and
insatiable mind, deeming that nothing had been done
while aught remained to do, urged him to pass on to
the opposite passion of selfishness, and treat it in the
same manner, so that the whole domain of thought
might be covered. This he did in his <i>Wealth of Nations</i>,
which, though even a greater work than his <i>Moral
Sentiments</i>, is equally one-sided, in reference to the
principles which it assumes. It assumes that selfishness
is the main regulator of human affairs, just as his previous
work had assumed sympathy to be so. Between
the two works there elapsed an interval of seventeen
years; the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> not being published till
1776. But what shows that to their author both were
part of a single scheme, is the notable circumstance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
that, so early as 1753, he had laid down the principles
which his later work contains.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> This was while his
former work was still in meditation, and before it had
seen the light. It is, therefore, clear, that the study
which he made, first of one passion, and then of its opposite,
was not a capricious or accidental arrangement,
but was the consequence of that vast idea which presided
over all his labours, and which, when they are rightly
understood, gives to them a magnificent unity. And a
glorious object of ambition it was. His aspiring and
comprehensive genius, sweeping the distant horizon, and
taking in the intermediate space at a glance, sought to
traverse the whole ground in two separate and independent
directions, indulging the hope, that, by supplying
in one line of argument the premisses which were
wanting in the other, their opposite conclusions would
be compensatory rather than hostile, and would serve
as a broad and permanent basis on which one great
science of human nature might be safely built.</p>

<p>The <i>Wealth of Nations</i> is, as I have elsewhere observed,<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>
probably the most important book which has
ever been written, whether we consider the amount of
original thought which it contains, or its practical influence.
Its practical recommendations were extremely
favourable to those doctrines of freedom which the
eighteenth century ushered in; and this secured to
them an attention which otherwise they would not have
received. While, therefore, the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> was
the proximate cause of a great change in legislation,<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>
a deeper analysis will show, that the success of the book,
and, consequently, the alteration of the laws, depended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
upon the operation of more remote and general causes.
It must also be confessed, that those same causes predisposed
the mind of Adam Smith to the doctrines of
liberty, and gave him a sort of prejudice in favour of
conclusions which limited the interference of the legislator.
Thus much he borrowed from his age; but one
thing he did not borrow. His wide and organizing
mind was all his own. This would have made him great
under any circumstances; to make him powerful, required
a peculiar conjunction of events. That conjunction
he enjoyed, and he turned it to good account. The
influence of his contemporaries was enough to make
him liberal; his own capacity was enough to make him
comprehensive. He had, in a most remarkable degree,
that exuberance of thought, which is one of the highest
forms of genius, but which leads those who possess it
into distant excursions, which, though they have one
common aim, are often stigmatized as digressions, simply
because they who criticize are unable to discern the
great principle which pervades the whole, and unites
the various parts into a single scheme. This has been
especially the case with Adam Smith, whose immortal
work has often been exposed to such shallow objections.
And certainly, the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> displays a breadth
of treatment which those who cannot sympathize with,
are very likely to ridicule. The phenomena, not only
of wealth, but also of society in general, classified and
arranged under their various forms; the origin of the
division of labour, and the consequences which that
division has produced; the circumstances which gave
rise to the invention of money, and to the subsequent
changes in its value; the history of those changes traced
in different ages, and the history of the relations which
the precious metals bear to each other; an examination
of the connection between wages and profits, and of the
laws which govern the rise and fall of both; another
examination of the way in which these are concerned,
on the one hand, with the rent of land, and, on the
other hand, with the price of commodities; an inquiry
into the reason why profits vary in different trades, and
at different times; a succinct, but comprehensive, view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of the progress of towns in Europe since the fall of the
Roman Empire; the fluctuations, during several centuries,
in the prices of the food of the people, and a
statement of how it is, that, in different stages of society,
the relative cost of land and of meat varies; the history
of corporation laws and of municipal enactments, and
their bearing on the four great classes of apprentices,
manufacturers, merchants, and landlords; an account
of the immense power and riches formerly enjoyed by
the clergy, and of the manner in which, as society advances,
they gradually lose their exclusive privileges;
the nature of religious dissent, and the reason why the
clergy of the established Church can never contend
with it on terms of equality, and, therefore, call on the
State to help them, and wish to persecute when they
cannot persuade; why some sects profess more ascetic
principles, and others more luxurious ones; how it was,
that, during the feudal times, the nobles acquired their
power, and how that power has, ever since, been gradually
diminishing; how the rights of territorial jurisdiction
originated, and how they died away; how the
sovereigns of Europe obtained their revenue, what the
sources of it are, and what classes are most heavily taxed
in order to supply it; the cause of certain virtues, such
as hospitality, flourishing in barbarous ages, and decaying
in civilized ones; the influence of inventions and
discoveries in altering the distribution of power among
the various classes of society; a bold and masterly sketch
of the peculiar sort of advantages which Europe derived
from the discovery of America and of the passage round
the Cape; the origin of universities, their degeneracy
from their original plan, the corruption which has gradually
crept over them, and the reason why they are so
unwilling to adopt improvements, and to keep pace with
the wants of the age; a comparison between public and
private education, and an estimate of their relative advantages;&mdash;these,
and a vast number of other subjects,
respecting the structure and development of society,
such as the feudal system, slavery, emancipation of serfs,
origin of standing armies, and of mercenary troops, effects
produced by tithes, laws of primogeniture, sumptuary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
laws, international treaties concerning trade, rise of
European banks, national debts, influence of dramatic
representations over opinions, influence of foreign travels
over opinions, colonies, poor-laws,&mdash;all topics of a miscellaneous
character, and many of them diverging from
each other,&mdash;all are fused into one great system, and
irradiated by the splendour of one great genius. Into
that dense and disorderly mass, did Adam Smith introduce
symmetry, method, and law. At his touch, anarchy
disappeared, and darkness was succeeded by light.
Much, of course, he took from his predecessors, though
nothing like so much as is commonly supposed. On
this sort of borrowing, the best and strongest of us are
dependent. But, after making every possible allowance
for what he gathered from others, we must honestly say,
that no single man ever took so great a step upon so
important a subject, and that no single work which is
now preserved, contains so many views, which were
novel at the time, but which subsequent experience has
ratified. What, however, for our present purpose, is
most important to observe, is, that he obtained these
results by arguing from principles which the selfish part
of human nature exclusively supplied, and that he
omitted those sympathetic feelings of which every human
being possesses at least some share, but which he could
not take into consideration, without producing a problem,
the number of whose complications it would have
been hopeless to unravel.</p>

<p>To avoid, therefore, being baffled, he simplified the
problem, by erasing from his view of human nature those
premisses which he had already handled in his <i>Theory
of Moral Sentiments</i>. At the beginning of the <i>Wealth of
Nations</i>, he lays down two propositions: 1st, that all
wealth is derived, not from land, but from labour; and
2d, that the amount of the wealth depends, partly on the
skill with which the labour is conducted, and partly on
the proportion between the number of those who labour
and the number of those who do not labour. The rest
of the work, is an application of these principles, to explain
the growth and mechanism of society. In applying
them, he everywhere assumes, that the great moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
power of all men, all interests, and all classes, in all
ages, and in all countries, is selfishness. The opposite
power of sympathy he entirely shuts out; and I hardly
remember an instance in which even the word occurs
in the whole course of his work. Its fundamental assumption
is, that each man exclusively follows his own
interest, or what he deems to be his own interest. And
one of the peculiar features of his book is, to show that,
considering society as a whole, it nearly always happens
that men, in promoting their own interest, will unintentionally
promote the interest of others. Hence, the
great practical lesson is, not to restrain selfishness, but
to enlighten it; because there is a provision in the
nature of things, by which the selfishness of the individual
accelerates the progress of the community. According
to this view, the prosperity of a country depends
on the amount of its capital; the amount of its capital
depends on the habit of saving, that is, on parsimony,
as opposed to generosity; while the habit of saving is,
in its turn, governed by the desire we all feel of bettering
our condition,&mdash;a desire so inherent in our nature,
that it comes with us from the womb, and only leaves
us in the grave.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>This constant effort of every man, to better his own
condition, is so salutary, as well as so powerful, that it
is often capable of securing the progress of society, in
spite of the folly and extravagance of the rulers of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
If it were not for this propensity, improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
would be impossible. For human institutions are constantly
stopping our advance, by thwarting our natural
inclinations.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> And no wonder that this should be the
case, seeing that the men who are at the head of affairs,
and by whom the institutions are contrived, have, perhaps,
a certain rough and practical sagacity; but being,
from the narrowness of their understandings, incapable
of large views, their councils are determined by those
mere casual fluctuations which alone they are able to
perceive.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> They do not see that we have prospered,
not on account of their enactments, but in the teeth of
them; and that the real cause of our prosperity is the
fact that we enjoy undisturbed the fruit of our own
labour.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> Whenever this right is tolerably secure, every
man will be bent on procuring for himself either present
enjoyment or future profit; and if he does not aim at
one of these objects, he is void of common understanding.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
If he possess capital, he will probably aim at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
both, but, in doing so, he will never consider the interest
of others; his sole motive will be his own private
profit.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> And it is well that such should be the case.
For, by thus pursuing his personal interest, he aids
society more than if his views were generous and
exalted. Some people affect to carry on trade for the
good of others; but this is mere affectation, though, to
say the truth, it is an affectation not very common
among merchants, and many words are not needed to
dissuade them from so foolish a practice.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>In this way, Adam Smith completely changes the
premisses which he had assumed in his earlier work.
Here, he makes men naturally selfish; formerly, he had
made them naturally sympathetic.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Here, he represents
them as pursuing wealth for sordid objects, and
for the narrowest personal pleasures; formerly he represented
them as pursuing it out of regard to the
sentiments of others, and for the sake of obtaining their
sympathy.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> In the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, we hear no
more of this conciliatory and sympathetic spirit; such
amiable maxims are altogether forgotten, and the affairs
of the world are regulated by different principles. It
now appears that benevolence and affection have no influence
over our actions. Indeed, Adam Smith will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
hardly admit common humanity into his theory of
motives. If a people emancipate their slaves, it is a
proof, not that the people are acted on by high moral
considerations, nor that their sympathy is excited by
the cruelty inflicted on these unhappy creatures.
Nothing of the sort. Such inducements to conduct are
imaginary, and exercise no real sway. All that the
emancipation proves, is, that the slaves were few in
number, and, therefore, small in value. Otherwise, they
would not have been emancipated.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>So, too, while in his former work, he had ascribed
the different systems of morals to the power of sympathy,
he, in this work, ascribes them entirely to the
power of selfishness. He observes, that, among the
lower ranks of society, dissipation is more fatal to individuals,
than it is among the higher ranks. The extravagance
which dissipation produces, may injure the
fortune of a wealthy man, but the injury is usually
capable of being repaired, or, at all events, he can indulge
his vices for years without completely destroying
his fortune, and without bringing himself to utter ruin.
To the labourer, a similar indulgence would be fatal in
a single week; it would not merely reduce him to beggary,
and perhaps send him to jail, but it would destroy
his future prospects, by taking away that character for
sobriety and regularity on which his employment depends.
Hence, the better class of common people,
guided by their interest, look with aversion on excesses
which they know to be fatal; while the upper ranks
finding that a moderate amount of vice hurts neither
their purse nor their reputation consider such license to
be one of the advantages which their fortune confers,
and they value, as one of the privileges belonging to
their station, the liberty of indulging themselves without
being censured. Therefore it is, that they who
dissent from the established Church have a purer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
system of morals, or, at all events, an austerer one, than
they who agree with it. For, new religious sects usually
begin among the common people, the thinking part of
whom are, by their interest, driven to strict views of
the duties of life. Consequently, the advocates of the
new opinion profess a similar strictness, seeing that it
is the surest means of increasing their proselytes. Thus
it is that sectaries and heretics, governed by interest
rather than by principle, adopt a code of morals which
is suited to their own purpose, and the rigidity of which
is strongly contrasted with the laxer code of more orthodox
believers.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> Owing to the operation of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
principle, we also find, that, among the orthodox themselves,
the clergy embrace a stricter system of morals in
countries where church benefices are nearly equal than
they do in countries where the benefices are very
unequal. This is because, when all the benefices are
nearly equal, none can be very rich, and, consequently,
even the most conspicuous among the clergy will have
but small incomes. But a man who has little to spend
can have no influence, unless his morals are exemplary.
Having no wealth to give him weight the vices of levity
would make him ridiculous. To avoid contempt, and
also to avoid the expense which a looseness of conduct
occasions, and which his narrow circumstances cannot
afford, he has but one remedy, and that remedy he
adopts. He retains his influence, and saves his pocket,
by protesting against pleasures which he cannot conveniently
enjoy; in this, as in all other cases, pursuing
that plan of life which his own interest urges him to
follow.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>In these striking generalizations, which, though they
contain a large amount of truth, are far from containing
the whole truth, no room is left for the magnanimous
parts of our nature to act; but the system of morals,
prevailing at any one time or in any one class, is solely
ascribed to the dictates of unalloyed selfishness. Adam
Smith, by reasoning from this principle, with that exquisite
subtlety which characterized his mind, explains
many other circumstances which society presents, and
which at first sight appear incongruous. According to
the old notions, which, indeed, are not yet quite extinct,
those who received wages were under a personal obligation
to those who paid them; that is to say, they were
under a moral obligation, over and above the obligation
of performing certain services. It was believed that a
master could not only select what servants he chose, but
could pay them what he chose; or, at all events, that
it was the will of the masters, considered as a body,
which fixed the usual and average rate of wages.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> The
lower classes were, therefore, much indebted to the
higher ones for giving them so much as they did; and
it was incumbent upon all persons, who received wages,
to take them with humble thankfulness, and with a
feeling of gratitude, on account of the favour bestowed
upon them by the generosity of their superiors.</p>

<p>This doctrine, so convenient to the upper classes of
society, and so natural to the universal ignorance which
formerly prevailed on these matters, began to be shaken
by the speculative thinkers of the seventeenth century;
but it was reserved for the eighteenth century to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
overthrow it, by letting in the great idea of necessity,
and proving, that the rate of wages established in a country,
was the inevitable consequence of the circumstances
in which that country was placed, and had no connexion
with the wishes of any individual, or, indeed, with the
wishes of any class. To all instructed persons, this is
now a familiar truth. Its discovery has excluded the
notion of gratitude from the pecuniary relation between
employers and employed, and has made known that
servants or workmen who receive wages, have no more
reason to be grateful than those who pay them. For,
no choice having been exercised in fixing the wages, no
favour can be conferred in their payment. The whole
process is compulsory, and is the result of what had
previously happened. Scarcely had the eighteenth
century passed away, when this most important discovery
was completed. It was decisively proved, that
the reward of labour depends solely on two things;
namely, the magnitude of that national fund out of
which all labour is paid, and the number of the
labourers among whom the fund is to be divided.</p>

<p>This vast step in our knowledge is due, mainly, though
not entirely, to Malthus, whose work on Population,
besides marking an epoch in the history of speculative
thought, has already produced considerable practical
results, and will probably give rise to others more considerable
still. It was published in 1798; so that Adam
Smith, who died in 1790, missed what to him would
have been the intense pleasure of seeing how, in it, his
own views were expanded rather than corrected. Indeed,
it is certain, that without Smith there would have
been no Malthus; that is, unless Smith had laid the
foundation, Malthus could not have raised the superstructure.
It was Adam Smith, who, far more than any
other man, introduced the conception of uniform and
necessary sequence into the apparently capricious phenomena
of wealth, and who studied those phenomena
by the aid of principles, of which selfishness alone supplied
the data. According to his view, the employers
of labour have, as employers, no benevolence, no sympathy,
no virtue of any kind. Their sole aim is, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
own selfish interest. They are constantly engaged in a
tacit, if not in an open, combination, to prevent the
lower ranks from being benefited by a rise of wages;
and they sometimes combine for the purpose even of
depressing those wages below their actual rate.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>
Having no bowels, they think only of themselves. The
idea of their wishing to mitigate the inequalities of
fortune, is to be exploded as one of the chimeras of that
protective spirit, which imagined that society could
not go on, unless the richer classes relieved the poorer
ones, and sympathized with their troubles. This antiquated
notion is further rebutted by the fact, that wages
are always higher in summer than in winter, although
the expenses which a labourer incurs in winter, being
heavier than in summer, he ought, on principles of
common humanity, to receive more money during the
more expensive season.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> In the same way, in years of
scarcity, the dearness of food causes many persons to
go to service, in order to support their families. The
masters, instead of charitably paying such servants
more on account of the unfortunate position in which
they are placed, avail themselves of that position to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
pay them less. They make better terms for themselves;
they lower wages just at the moment when sympathy
for misfortune would have raised them; and, as they
find that their servants, besides being worse remunerated,
are, by poverty, made more submissive, they consider
that scarcity is a blessing, and that dear years
are to be commended as more favourable to industry
than cheap ones.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>Adam Smith, therefore, though he failed in grasping
the remote cause of the rate of wages, clearly saw that
the approximate cause was, not the generosity of human
nature, but its selfishness, and that the question was
one of supply and demand; each side striving to extract
as much as possible from the other.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> By the aid of
the same principle, he explained another curious fact,
namely, the extravagant rewards bestowed on some of
the most despicable classes of society, such, for instance,
as opera-dancers, who always receive enormous pay for
insignificant services. He observes, that one of the
reasons why we pay them so highly, is, because we
despise them. If to be a public dancer were a creditable
occupation, more persons would be brought up to
it, and the supply of public dancers becoming greater,
competition would lower their wages. As it is, we
look on them disdainfully. By way of compensating
the disdain, we have to bribe them largely to induce
them to follow their pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> Here we see, that the
reward which one class bestows on another, instead of
being increased by sympathy, is increased by scorn; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
that the more we contemn the tastes and the way of
life of our fellow-creatures, the more liberal we are in
recompensing them.</p>

<p>Passing to another, and somewhat different, class,
Adam Smith threw new light on the cause of that hospitality
for which the clergy were famous during the
Middle Ages, and for the magnificence of which they
have received great praise. He shows that, although
they undoubtedly relieved a large amount of distress,
this is not to be ascribed to them as a merit, since it
resulted from the peculiarity of their position, and since,
moreover, they did it for their own advantage. In the
Middle Ages, the clergy possessed enormous wealth,
and their revenues were mostly paid, not in money, but
in kind, such as corn, wine, and cattle. Trade and
manufactures being hardly known, the clergy could
find no use for these commodities except to feed other
people. By employing them in that way, they benefited
themselves in the most effectual manner. They
gained a reputation for extensive charity; they increased
their influence; they multiplied the number of their
adherents; and they not only advanced themselves to
temporal power, but they secured to their spiritual
threats a respect, which, without this contrivance, it
would have been impossible for them to obtain.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>The reader will now be able to understand the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
of that method of investigation which is adopted in the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, and of which I have given more
instances than I should otherwise have done, partly
because the question of philosophic method lies at the
very root of our knowledge, and partly because no
attempt has hitherto been made to analyze the intellect
of Adam Smith, by considering his two great works as
the opposite, but yet the compensatory, parts of a single
scheme. And, as he is by far the greatest thinker
Scotland has produced, I need hardly apologize, in a
history of the Scotch mind, for devoting so much
attention to his system, and endeavouring to examine
it at its base. But, having done so, it would be a
needless prolixity to treat with equal fulness the productions
of those other eminent Scotchmen who lived
at the same time, and nearly all of whom pursued a
method essentially, though not entirely, the same; that
is to say, they preferred the deductive process of
reasoning from principles, to the inductive process of
reasoning to them. In that peculiar form of deduction
which consists in a deliberate suppression of part of
the principles, Adam Smith stands alone. For, though
others attempted to follow that plan, they did so
irregularly, and at intervals, and did not, like him, see
the importance of keeping close to their method, and
of invariably abstaining from letting into the premisses
of their arguments, considerations which would complicate
the problem that they wished to solve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the contemporaries of Adam Smith, one of
the first, in eminence, as well as in reputation, is David
Hume. His views respecting political economy were
published in 1752,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> that is, the very year in which
Adam Smith taught the principles subsequently unfolded
in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>. But Hume, though a
most accomplished reasoner, as well as a profound and
fearless thinker, had not the comprehensiveness of
Adam Smith, nor had he that invaluable quality of
imagination without which no one can so transport
himself into past ages as to realize the long and progressive
movements of society, always fluctuating, yet,
on the whole, steadily advancing. How unimaginative
he was, appears, not only from the sentiments he expressed,
but likewise from many traits in his private
life.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> It appears, also, in the very colour and mechanism
of his language; that beautiful and chiselled
style in which he habitually wrote, polished as marble,
but cold as marble too, and wanting that fiery enthusiasm
and those bursts of tempestuous eloquence,
which, ever and anon, great objects naturally inspire,
and which rouse men to their inmost depths. This it
was, which, in his <i>History of England</i>,&mdash;that exquisite
production of art, which, in spite of its errors, will be
admired as long as taste remains among us,&mdash;prevented
him from sympathizing with those bold and generous
natures, who, in the seventeenth century, risked their
all to preserve the liberty of their country. His imagination
was not strong enough to picture the whole of
that great century, with its vast discoveries, its longings
after the unknown, its splendid literature, and what
was better than all these, its stern determination to
vindicate freedom, and to put down tyranny. His clear
and powerful understanding saw these things separately,
and in their various parts, but could not fuse
them into a single form, because he lacked that peculiar
faculty which assimilates the past to the present, and
enables the mind to discern both with almost equal ease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
That Great Rebellion, which he ascribed to the spirit of
faction, and the leaders of which he turned into ridicule,
was but the continuation of a movement which can be
clearly traced to the twelfth century, and of which such
events as the invention of printing, and the establishment
of the Reformation, were merely successive symptoms.
For all this, Hume cared nothing. In regard
to philosophy, and in regard to the purely speculative
parts of religious doctrines, his penetrating genius
enabled him to perceive that nothing could be done,
except by a spirit of fearless and unrestrained liberty.
But this was the liberty of his own class; the liberty
of thinkers, and not of actors. His absence of imagination
prevented him from extending the range of his
sympathy beyond the intellectual classes, that is, beyond
the classes of whose feelings he was directly
cognizant. It would, therefore, appear, that his political
errors were due, not, as is commonly said, to his
want of research, but rather to the coldness of his
temperament.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> It was this which made him stop
where he did, and which gave to his works the singular
appearance of a profound and original thinker, in the
middle of the eighteenth century, advocating practical
doctrines, so illiberal, that, if enforced, they would lead to
despotism, and yet, at the same time, advocating speculative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
doctrines, so fearless and enlightened, that they
were not only far in advance of his own age, but have, in
some degree, outstripped even the age in which we live.</p>

<p>Among his speculative views, the most important are
his theory of causation as discarding the idea of power,
and his theory of the laws of association. Neither of
these theories are, in their primary conception, quite
original, but his treatment made them as valuable as if
they had been entirely his own. His theory of miracles,
in connexion, on the one hand, with the principles of
evidence, and, on the other hand, with the laws of causation,
is worked out with consummate skill, and, after
having received the modifications subsequently imposed
by Brown, has now become the foundation on which
the best inquirers into these matters take their stand.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
His work on the principles of morals, by generalizing
the laws of expediency, prepared the way for Bentham,
who afterwards incorporated with them an estimate of
the more remote consequences of human actions; Hume,
having chiefly confined himself to their more immediate
consequences. The doctrine of utility was common to
each; but while Hume applied it mainly to the individual,
Bentham applied it to the surrounding society.
Though Bentham was more comprehensive, yet Hume,
having come first, was more original. The praise of
originality must also be accorded to his economical
theories, in which he advocated those principles of free
trade, which politicians began to adopt many years
after his death.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> In opposition to the notions then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
prevailing, he distinctly asserted, that all commodities,
though apparently bought by money, are in reality
bought by labour.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> Money, therefore, is not the subject
of commerce, and is of no use except to facilitate
it.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> Hence, it is absurd for a nation to trouble itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
about the balance of trade, or to make regulations to
discourage the exportation of the precious metals.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>
Neither does the average rate of interest depend on
their scarcity or abundance, but upon the operation of
more general causes.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> As a necessary consequence of
these positions, Hume inferred that the established
policy was wrong, which made trading states look upon
each other as rivals, while, in point of fact, the question,
if considered from a certain height, was one, not of
rivalry, but of coöperation; every country being benefited
by the increasing wealth of its neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> Those
who know the character of commercial legislation, and
the opinions of even the most enlightened statesmen a
century ago, will consider these views as extremely
remarkable to have been propounded in the year 1752.
But what is more remarkable still, is, that their author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
subsequently detected the fundamental error which
Adam Smith committed, and which vitiates many of his
conclusions. The error consists in his having resolved
price into three components, namely, wages, profit, and
rent; whereas it is now known that price is a compound
of wages and profit, and that rent is not an element of
it, but a result of it. This discovery is the corner-stone
of political economy; but it is established by an argument
so long and so refined, that most minds are unable
to pursue it without stumbling, and the majority of
those who acquiesce in it are influenced by the great
writers to whom they pay deference, and whose judgment
they follow. It is, therefore, a striking proof of
the sagacity of Hume, that in an age when the science
was but dawning, and when he could receive little help
from his predecessors, he should have discovered a mistake
of this sort, which lies so far beneath the surface.
Directly the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> appeared, he wrote to
Adam Smith, disputing his position that rent is a part
of price;<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> and this letter, written in the year 1776, is
the first indication of that celebrated theory of rent,
which, a little later, Anderson, Malthus, and West, saw,
and imperfectly developed, but which it was reserved
for the genius of Ricardo to build up on a broad and
solid foundation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very observable, that Hume and Adam Smith,
who made such immense additions to our knowledge
of the principles of trade, had no practical acquaintance
with it.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Hume had, at an early period of his life,
been in a mercantile house; but he threw up that employment
in disgust, and buried himself in a provincial
town, to think, rather than to observe.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> Indeed, one
of the capital defects of his mind, was a disregard of
facts. This did not proceed, as is too often the case,
from that worst form of moral obliquity, an indifference
to truth; since he, on the contrary, was an ardent
lover of it, and was, moreover, a man of the purest and
most exemplary character, utterly incapable of falsehood,
or of prevarication of any kind.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> In him, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
contempt for facts was merely the exaggerated result of
a devotion to ideas. He not only believed, with perfect
justice, that ideas are more important than facts, but
he supposed that they should hold the first place
in the order of study, and that they should be developed
before the facts are investigated. The Baconian
philosophy, which, though it allows a preliminary and
tentative hypothesis, strongly insists upon the necessity
of first collecting the facts, and then proceeding to the
ideas, excited his aversion; and this, I have no doubt,
is the reason why he, who was usually so lenient in his
judgments, and was so keen an admirer of intellectual
greatness is, nevertheless, grossly unfair towards
Bacon, with whose method it was impossible for him to
sympathize, though he could not deny its utility, in
physical science.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> If Hume had followed the Baconian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
scheme, of always rising from particulars to generals,
and from each generalization to that immediately above
it, he would hardly have written one of his works.
Certainly, his economical views would never have appeared,
since political economy is as essentially a
deductive science as geometry itself.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> Reversing the
inductive process, he was in favour of beginning with
what he termed general arguments, by which he hoped
to demonstrate the inaccuracy of opinions which facts
were supposed to have proved.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> He did not stop to
investigate the facts from which the inference had been
drawn, but he inverted the order by which the inference
was to be obtained. The same dislike to make the
facts of trade the basis of the science of trade, was displayed
by Adam Smith, who expresses his want of
confidence in statistics, or, as it was then termed,
political arithmetic.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> It is, however, evident, that
statistical facts are as good as any other facts, and,
owing to their mathematical form, are very precise.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
But when they concern human actions, they are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
result of all the motives which govern those actions;
in other words, they are the result, not merely of
selfishness, but also of sympathy. And as Adam
Smith, in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, dealt with only one
of these passions, namely, selfishness, he would have
found it impossible to conduct his generalization from
statistics, which are necessarily collected from the products
of both passions. Such statistical facts were, in
their origin, too complex to be generalized; especially
as they could not be experimented upon, but could
only be observed and arranged. Adam Smith, perceiving
them to be unmanageable, very properly rejected
them as the basis of his science, and merely used
them by way of illustration, when he could select what
he liked. The same remark applies to other facts
which he drew from the history of trade, and, indeed,
from the general history of society. All of these are
essentially subsequent to the argument. They make
the argument more clear, but not more certain. For,
it is no exaggeration to say, that, if all the commercial
and historical facts in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> were false,
the book would still remain, and its conclusions would
hold equally good, though they would be less attractive.
In it, every thing depends upon general principles,
and they, as we have seen, were arrived at in
1752, that is, twenty-four years before the work was
published in which those principles were applied.
They must, therefore, have been acquired independently
of the facts which Adam Smith, subsequently incorporated
with them, and which he learnt during that long
period of twenty-four years. And the ten years which
he employed in composing his great work, were not
spent in one of those busy haunts of men, where he
might have observed all the phenomena of industry,
and studied the way in which the operations of trade
affect human character, and are affected by it. He did
not resort to one of those vast marts and emporiums of
commerce, where the events were happening which he
was seeking to explain. That was not his method.
On the contrary, the ten years, during which he was
occupied in raising to a science the most active department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
of life, were passed in complete seclusion in
Kirkaldy, his quiet little birthplace.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> He had always
been remarkable for absence of mind, and was so little
given to observation, as to be frequently oblivious of
what was passing around him.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> In that obliviousness,
he, amid the tranquil scenes of his childhood, could
now indulge without danger. There, cheered, indeed,
by the society of his mother, but with no opportunity
of observing human nature upon a large scale, and far
removed from the hum of great cities, did this mighty
thinker, by the force of his own mind, unravel the
numerous and complicated phenomena of wealth, detect
the motives which regulate the conduct of the most
energetic and industrious portion of mankind, and lay
bare the schemes and the secrets of that active life
from which he was shut out, while he, immured in
comparative solitude, was unable to witness the very
facts which he succeeded in explaining.</p>

<p>The same determination to make the study of principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
precede that of facts, is exhibited by Hume in
one of his most original works, the <i>Natural History of
Religion</i>. In reference to the title of this treatise, we
must observe that, according to the Scotch philosophers,
the natural course of any movement is by no
means the same as its actual course. This discrepancy
between the ideal and the real, was the unavoidable
result of their method.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> For, as they argued deductively
from fixed premisses, they could not take into
account the perturbations to which their conclusions
were liable, from the play and friction of the surrounding
society. To do that, required a separate inquiry.
It would have been needful to investigate the circumstances
which caused the friction, and thus prevented
the conclusions from being, in the world of fact, the
same as they were in the world of speculation. What
we call accidents, are constantly happening, and they
prevent the real march of affairs from being identical
with the natural march. And, as long as we are
unable to predict those accidents, there will always be
a want of complete harmony between the inferences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
a deductive science and the realities of life; in other
words, our inferences will tend towards truth, but
never completely attain it.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p>With peculiar propriety, therefore, did Hume term
his work a <i>Natural History of Religion</i>. It is an
admirable specimen of the deductive method. Its only
fault is that he speaks too confidently of the accuracy of
the results to which, on such a subject, that method
could attain. He believed, that, by observing the
principles of human nature, as he found them in his
own mind, it was possible to explain the whole course
of affairs, both moral and physical.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> These principles
were to be arrived at by experiments made on himself;
and having thus arrived at them, he was to reason
from them deductively, and so construct the entire
scheme. This he contrasts with the inductive plan,
which he calls a tedious and lingering process; and
while others might follow that slow and patient method
of gradually working their way towards first principles,
his project was, to seize them at once, or, as he expresses
himself, not to stop at the frontier, but to march
directly on the capital, being possessed of which, he
could gain an easy victory over other difficulties,
and could extend his conquests over the sciences.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
According to Hume, we are to reason, not in order to
obtain ideas, but we are to have clear ideas before we
reason.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> By this means, we arrive at philosophy; and
her conclusions are not to be impugned, even if they do
happen to clash with science. On the contrary, her
authority is supreme, and her decisions, being essentially
true, must always be preferred to any generalization
of the facts which the external world presents.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>Hume, therefore, believed that all the secrets of the
external world are wrapped up in the human mind.
The mind was not only the key by which the treasure
could be unlocked; it was also the treasure itself.
Learning and science might illustrate and beautify our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
mental acquisitions, but they could not communicate
real knowledge; they could neither give the prime
original materials, nor could they teach the design according
to which those materials must be worked.</p>

<p>In conformity with these views, the <i>Natural History
of Religion</i> was composed. The object of Hume in
writing it, was, to ascertain the origin and progress of
religious ideas; and he arrives at the conclusion, that
the worship of many Gods must, every where, have
preceded the worship of one God. This, he regards as
a law of the human mind, a thing not only that always
has happened, but that always must happen. His proof
is entirely speculative. He argues that the earliest state
of man is necessarily a savage state; that savages can
feel no interest in the ordinary operations of nature,
and no desire to study the principles which govern
those operations; that such men must be devoid of
curiosity on all subjects which do not personally
trouble them; and that, therefore, while they neglect
the usual events of nature, they will turn their minds
to the unusual ones.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> A violent tempest, a monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
birth, excessive cold, excessive rain, sudden and fatal
diseases, are the sort of things to which the attention
of the savage is confined, and of which alone he desires
to know the causes. Directly he finds that such causes
are beyond his control, he reckons them superior to
himself, and, being incapable of abstracting them, he
personifies them; he turns them into deities; polytheism
is established; and the earliest creed of mankind
assumes a form which can never be altered, as long as
men remain in this condition of pristine ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p>These propositions, which are not only plausible, but
which are probably true, ought, according to the inductive
philosophy, to have been generalized from a
survey of facts; that is, from a collection of evidence
respecting the state of religion and of the speculative
faculties among savage tribes. But this, Hume abstains
from doing. He refers to none of the numerous
travellers who have visited such people; he does not,
in the whole course of his work, mention even a single
book where facts respecting savage life are preserved.
It was enough for him, that the progress from a belief
in many Gods to a belief in one God, was the natural
progress; which is saying, in other words, that it appeared
to his mind to be the natural progress.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> With
that, he was satisfied. In other parts of his essay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
where he treats of the religious opinions of the ancient
Greeks and Romans, he displays a tolerable, though by
no means remarkable, learning; but the passages
which he cites, do not refer to that entirely barbarous
society in which, as he supposes, polytheism first arose.
The premisses, therefore, of the argument are evolved
out of his own mind. He reasons deductively from the
ideas which his powerful intellect supplied, instead of
reasoning inductively from the facts which were peculiar
to the subject he was investigating.</p>

<p>Even in the rest of his work, which is full of refined
and curious speculation, he uses facts, not to demonstrate
his conclusions, but to illustrate them. He, therefore,
selected those facts which suited his purpose, leaving
the others untouched. And this, which many critics
would call unfair, was not unfair in him; because he
believed, that he had already established his principles
without the aid of those facts. The facts might benefit
the reader, by making the argument clearer, but they
could not strengthen the argument. They were more
intended to persuade than to prove; they were rather
rhetorical than logical. Hence, a critic would waste
his time if he were to sift them with a minuteness
which would be necessary, supposing that Hume had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
built an inductive argument upon them. Otherwise,
without going far, it might be curious to contrast them
with the entirely different facts which Cudworth, eighty
years before, had collected from the same source, and
on the same subject. Cudworth, who was much superior
to Hume in learning, and much inferior to him in
genius,<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> displayed, in his great work on the <i>Intellectual
System of the Universe</i>, a prodigious erudition, to prove
that, in the ancient world, the belief in one God was a
prevailing doctrine. Hume, who never refers to Cudworth,
arrives at a precisely opposite conclusion. Both
quoted ancient writers; but while Cudworth drew his
inferences from what he found in those writers, Hume
drew his from what he found in his own mind. Cudworth,
being more learned, relied on his reading;
Hume, having more genius, relied on his intellect.
Cudworth, trained in the school of Bacon, first collected
the evidence, and then passed the judgment. Hume,
formed in a school entirely different, believed that the
acuteness of the judge was more important than the
quantity of the evidence; that witnesses were likely to
prevaricate; and that he possessed, in his own mind,
the surest materials for arriving at an accurate conclusion.
It is not, therefore, strange, that Cudworth
and Hume, pursuing opposite methods, should have
obtained opposite results, since such a discrepancy is,
as I have already pointed out, unavoidable, when men
investigate, according to different plans, a subject which,
in the existing state of knowledge, is not amenable to
scientific treatment.</p>

<p>The length to which this chapter has already extended,
and the number of topics which I have still to
handle, will prevent me from examining, in detail, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
philosophy of Reid, who was the most eminent among
the purely speculative thinkers of Scotland, after Hume
and Adam Smith, though, in point of merit, he must be
placed far below them. For, he had neither the comprehensiveness
of Smith, nor the fearlessness of Hume.
The range of his knowledge was not wide enough to
allow him to be comprehensive; while a timidity, almost
amounting to moral cowardice, made him recoil
from the views advocated by Hume, not so much on
account of their being false, as on account of their being
dangerous. It is, however, certain, that no man can
take high rank as a philosopher, who allows himself to be
trammelled by considerations of that kind. A philosopher
should aim solely at truth, and should refuse to
estimate the practical tendency of his speculations. If
they are true, let them stand; if they are false, let them
fall. But, whether they are agreeable or disagreeable,
whether they are consolatory or disheartening, whether
they are safe or mischievous, is a question, not for philosophers,
but for practical men. Every new truth
which has ever been propounded, has, for a time, caused
mischief; it has produced discomfort, and often unhappiness,
sometimes by disturbing social or religious
arrangements, and sometimes merely by the disruption
of old and cherished associations of thought. It is only
after a certain interval, and when the framework of
affairs has adjusted itself to the new truth, that its good
effects preponderate; and the preponderance continues
to increase, until, at length, the truth causes nothing
but good. But, at the outset, there is always harm.
And, if the truth is very great, as well as very new,
the harm is serious. Men are made uneasy; they
flinch; they cannot bear the sudden light; a general
restlessness supervenes; the face of society is disturbed,
or perhaps convulsed; old interests, and old beliefs, are
destroyed, before new ones have been created. These
symptoms are the precursors of revolution; they have
preceded all the great changes through which the world
has passed; and while, if they are not excessive, they
forebode progress, so if they are excessive, they
threaten anarchy. It is the business of practical men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
to moderate such symptoms, and to take care that the
truths which philosophers discover, are not applied so
rashly as to dislocate the fabric, instead of strengthening
it. But the philosopher has only to discover the truth,
and promulgate it; and that is hard work enough for
any man, let his ability be as great as it may. This
division of labour, between thinkers and actors, secures
an economy of force, and prevents either class from
wasting its power. It establishes a difference between
science, which ascertains principles, and art, which applies
them. It also recognizes, that the philosopher and
the practical man, having each a separate part to play,
each is, in his own field, supreme. But it is a sad confusion
for either to interfere with the other. In their
different spheres, both are independent, and both are
worthy of admiration. Inasmuch, however, as practical
men should never allow the speculative conclusions of
philosophers, whatever be their truth, to be put in actual
operation, unless society is, in some degree, ripe for
their reception; so, on the other hand, philosophers are
not to hesitate, and tremble, and stop short in their
career, because their intellect is leading them to conclusions
subversive of existing interests. The duty of a
philosopher is clear. His path lies straight before him.
He must take every pains to ascertain the truth; and,
having arrived at a conclusion, he, instead of shrinking
from it because it is unpalatable, or because it seems
dangerous, should on that very account, cling the closer
to it, should uphold it in bad repute, more zealously
than he would have done in good repute; should noise
it abroad far and wide, utterly regardless what opinions
he shocks, or what interests he imperils; should, on its
behalf, court hostility and despise contempt, being well
assured, that, if it is not true, it will die, but that, if it
is true, it must produce ultimate benefit, albeit unsuited
for practical adoption by the age or country in which it
is first propounded.</p>

<p>But Reid, notwithstanding the clearness of his mind
and his great powers of argument, had so little of the
real philosophic spirit, that he loved truth, not for its
own sake, but for the sake of its immediate and practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
results. He himself tells us, that he began to study
philosophy, merely because he was shocked at the consequences
at which philosophers had arrived. As long
as the speculations of Locke and of Berkeley were not
pushed to their logical conclusions, Reid acquiesced in
them, and they were good in his eyes.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> While they
were safe and tolerably orthodox, he was not over-nice
in inquiring into their validity. In the hands of Hume,
however, philosophy became bolder and more inquisitive;
she disturbed opinions which were ancient, and
which it was pleasant to hold; she searched into the
foundation of things, and by forcing men to doubt and
to inquire, she rendered inestimable service to the cause
of truth. But this was precisely the tendency at which
Reid was displeased. He saw that such disturbance
was uncomfortable; he saw that it was hazardous;
therefore, he endeavoured to prove that it was groundless.
Confusing the question of practical consequences
with the totally different question of scientific truth, he
took for granted that, because to his age the adoption
of those consequences would be mischievous, they must
be false. To the profound views of Hume respecting
causation, he gravely objects, that if they were carried
into effect, the operation of criminal law would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
imperilled.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> To the speculations of the same philosopher
concerning the metaphysical basis of the theory
of contracts, he replies, that such speculations perplex
men, and weaken their sense of duty; they are, therefore,
to be disapproved of, on account of their tendency.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
With Reid, the main question always is, not
whether an inference is true, but what will happen if
it is true. He says, that a doctrine is to be judged by
its fruits;<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> forgetting that the same doctrine will
bear different fruits in different ages, and that the consequences
which a theory produces in one state of
society, are often diametrically opposed to those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
it produces in another. He thus made his own age the
standard of all future ones. He also trammelled philosophy
with practical considerations; diverting thinkers
from the pursuit of truth, which is their proper department,
into the pursuit of expediency, which is not their
department at all. Reid was constantly stopping to
inquire, not whether theories were accurate, but whether
it was advisable to adopt them; whether they were
favourable to patriotism, or to generosity, or to friendship;<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>
in a word, whether they were comfortable, and
such as we should at present like to believe.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> Or else,
he would take other ground, still lower, and still more
unworthy of a philosopher. In opposing, for instance,
the doctrine, that our faculties sometimes deceive us,&mdash;a
doctrine which, as he well knew, had been held by
men whose honesty was equal to his own, and whose
ability was superior to his own,&mdash;he does not scruple to
enlist on his side the prejudices of a vulgar superstition;
seeking to blacken the tenet which he was unable to
refute. He actually asserts, that they who advocate it,
insult the Deity, by imputing to the Almighty that He
has lied. Such being the consequence of the opinion,
it of course follows that the opinion must be rejected
without further scrutiny, since, to accept it, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
produce fatal results on our conduct, and would, indeed,
be subversive of all religion, of all morals, and of all
knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>In 1764, Reid published his <i>Inquiry into the Human
Mind</i>; and in that, and in his subsequent work, entitled
<i>Essays on the Powers of the Mind</i>, he sought to destroy
the philosophy of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. And as
Hume was the boldest of the three, it was chiefly his
philosophy which Reid attacked. Of the character of
this attack, some specimens have just been given; but
they rather concern his object and motives, while what
we have now to ascertain is, his method, that is, the
tactics of his warfare. He clearly saw, that Hume had
assumed certain principles, and had reasoned deductively
from them to the facts, instead of reasoning
inductively from the facts to them. To this method, he
strongly, and perhaps fairly, objects. He admits that
Hume had reasoned so accurately, that if his principles
were conceded, his conclusions must likewise be conceded.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>
But, he says, Hume had no right to proceed
in such a manner. He had no right to assume principles,
and then to argue from them. The laws of
nature were to be arrived at, not by conjecturing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
this way, but by a patient induction of facts.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> Discoveries
depended solely on observation and experiment;
and any other plan could only produce theories,
ingenious, perhaps, and plausible, but quite worthless.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>
For, theory should yield to fact, and not fact
to theory.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> Speculators, indeed, might talk about
first principles, and raise a system by reasoning from
them. But, the fact was, that there was no agreement
as to how a first principle was to be recognized; since
a principle which one man would deem self-evident,
another would think it necessary to prove, and a third
would altogether deny.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<p>The difficulties of deductive reasoning are here admirably
portrayed. It might have been expected, that
Reid would have built up his own philosophy according
to the inductive plan, and would have despised that
assumption of first principles, with which he taunts his
opponents. But it is one of the most curious things in
the history of metaphysics, that Reid after impeaching
the method of Hume, follows the very same method
himself. When he is attacking the philosophy of
Hume, he holds deduction to be wrong. When he is
raising his own philosophy, he holds it to be right. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
deemed certain conclusions dangerous, and he objects
to their advocates, that they argued from principles,
instead of from facts: and that they assumed themselves
to be in possession of the first principles of truth,
although people were not agreed as to what constituted
a first principle. This is well put, and hard to answer.
Strange, however, to say, Reid arrives at his own conclusions,
by assuming first principles to an extent far
greater than had been done by any writer on the opposite
side. From them, he argues; his whole scheme
is deductive; and his works scarcely contain a single
instance of that inductive logic, which, when attacking
his opponents, he found it convenient to recommend.
It is difficult to conceive a better illustration of the
peculiar character of the Scotch intellect in the
eighteenth century, and of the firm hold, which, what
may be called, the anti-Baconian method, had upon
that intellect. Reid was a man of considerable ability,
of immaculate honesty, and was deeply convinced that
it was for the good of society that the prevailing philosophy
should be overthrown. To the performance of
that task, he dedicated his long and laborious life; he
saw that the vulnerable point of the adverse system
was its method; he indicated the deficiencies of that
method, and declared, perhaps wrongly, but at all
events sincerely, that it could never lead to truth.
Yet, and notwithstanding all this, such was the pressure
of the age in which he lived, and so completely did the
force of circumstances shape his understanding, that,
in his own works, he was unable to avoid that very
method of investigation which he rebuked in others.
Indeed, so far from avoiding it, he was a slave to it.
The evidence of this I will now give, because, besides
its importance for the history of the Scotch mind, it is
valuable as one of many lessons, which teach us how
we are moulded by the society which surrounds us;
how even our most vigorous actions are influenced by
general causes of which we are often ignorant, and
which few of us care to study; and, finally, how lame
and impotent we are, when, as individuals, we try to
stem the onward current, resisting the great progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
instead of aiding it, and vainly opposing our little
wishes to that majestic course of events, which admits
of no interruption, but sweeps on, grand and
terrible, while generation after generation passes away,
successively absorbed in one mighty vortex.</p>

<p>Directly Reid, ceasing to refute the philosophy of
Hume, began to construct his own philosophy, he succumbed
to the prevailing method. He now assures us,
that all reasoning must be from first principles, and
that, so far from reasoning to those principles, we must
at once admit them, and make them the basis of all
subsequent arguments.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Having admitted them, they
become a thread to guide the inquirer through the
labyrinth of thought.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> His opponents had no right
to assume them, but he might do so, because to him
they were intuitive.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> Whoever denied them, was
not fit to be reasoned with.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> Indeed, to investigate
them, or to seek to analyze them, was wrong as well as
foolish, because they were part of the constitution of
things; and of the constitution of things no account
could be given, except that such was the will of God.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>As Reid obtained his first principles with such ease,
and as he carefully protected them by forbidding any
attempt to resolve them into simpler elements, he was
under a strong temptation to multiply them almost
indefinitely, in order that, by reasoning from them, he
might raise a complete and harmonious system of the
human mind. To that temptation he yielded with a
readiness, which is truly surprising, when we remember
how he reproached his opponents with doing the same
thing. Among the numerous first principles which he
assumes, not only as unexplained, but as inexplicable,
are the belief in Personal Identity;<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> the belief in the
External World;<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> the belief in the Uniformity of
Nature;<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> the belief in the Existence of Life in
Others;<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> the belief in Testimony;<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> also in the
power of distinguishing truth from error,<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> and even
in the correspondence of the face and voice to the
thoughts.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> Of belief generally, he asserts that there
are many principles,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> and he regrets that any one
should have rashly attempted to explain them.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> Such
things are mysterious, and not to be pried into. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
have also other faculties, which being original and indecomposable,
resist all inductive treatment, and can
neither be resolved into simpler elements, nor referred
to more general laws. To this class, Reid assigns
Memory,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> Perception,<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Desire of Self-Approbation,<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
and not only Instinct, but even Habit.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> Many of our
ideas, such as those concerning Space and Time, are
equally original;<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> and other first principles there are,
which have not been enunciated, but from which we
may reason.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> They, therefore, are the major premisses
of the argument; no reason having yet been
given for them, they must be simple; and not having
yet been explained, they are, of course, inexplicable.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>All this is arbitrary enough. Still, in justice to Reid,
it must be said, that, having made these assumptions,
he displayed remarkable ability in arguing from them,
and that, in attacking the philosophy of his time, he
subjected it to a criticism, which has been extremely
serviceable. His lucidity, his dialectic skill, and the
racy and masculine style in which he wrote, made him
a formidable opponent, and secured to his objections a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
respectful hearing. To me, however, it appears, that
notwithstanding the attempts, first of M. Cousin, and
afterwards of Sir William Hamilton, to prop up his
declining reputation, his philosophy, as an independent
system, is untenable, and will not live. In this I may
be mistaken; but what is quite certain is, that nothing
can be more absurd than to suppose, as some have
done, that he adopted the inductive, or, as it is popularly
called, Baconian method. Bacon, indeed, would
have smiled at such a disciple, assuming all sorts of
major premisses, taking general principles for granted
with the greatest recklessness, and reserving his skill
for the task of reasoning from propositions for which
he had no evidence, except that on a cursory, or, as he
termed it, a common-sense, inspection, they appeared
to be true.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> This refusal to analyze preconceived
notions, comes under the head of what Bacon stigmatized
as the <i>anticipatio naturæ</i>, and which he deemed
the great enemy of knowledge, on account of the dangerous
confidence it places in the spontaneous and
uncorrected conclusions of the human mind. When,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
therefore, we find Reid holding up the Baconian philosophy,
as a pattern which it behoves all inquirers to
follow;<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and when we, moreover, find Dugald Stewart,
who, though a somewhat superficial thinker, was, at
all events, a careful writer, supposing that Reid had
followed it,<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> we meet with fresh proof of how difficult
it was for Scotchmen of the last age to imbibe the true
spirit of inductive logic, since they believed, that a
system which flagrantly violated its rules, had been
framed in strict accordance with them.</p>

<p>Leaving mental philosophy, I now come to physical
science, in which, if anywhere, we might expect that
the inductive plan would predominate, and would triumph
over the opposite, or deductive, one. How far
this was the case, I will endeavour to ascertain, by an
examination of the most important discoveries which
have been made by Scotchmen concerning the organic
and inorganic world. And, as my object is merely to
indicate the turn and character of the Scotch mind, I
shall avoid all details respecting the practical effects of
those discoveries, and shall confine myself to such a
narration as will exhibit their purely scientific aspect,
so as to enable the reader to understand what additions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
were made to our knowledge of the laws of nature, and
in what way the additions were made. The character
of each discovery, and its process, will be stated, but
nothing more. Neither here, nor in any part of this
Introduction, do I pretend to investigate questions of
practical utility, or to trace the connexion between the
discoveries of science and the arts of life. That I shall
do in the body of the work itself, where I hope to explain
a number of minute social events, many of which
are regarded as isolated, if not incongruous. For the
present, I solely aim at those broad principles, which,
by marking out the epochs of thought, underlie the
whole fabric of society, and which must be clearly
apprehended before history can cease to be a mere
empirical assemblage of facts, of which the scientific
basis being unsettled, the true order and coherence must
be unknown.</p>

<p>Among the sciences which concern the inorganic
world, the laws of heat occupy a conspicuous place. On
the one hand, they are connected with geology, being
intimately allied, and, indeed, necessarily bound up,
with every speculation respecting the changes and present
condition of the crust of the earth. On the other
hand, they touch the great questions of life, both animal
and vegetable; they have to do with the theory of species,
and of race; they modify soil, food, and organization;
and to them we must look for valuable help
towards solving those great problems in biology, which,
of late years, have occupied the attention of the boldest
and most advanced philosophers.</p>

<p>Our present knowledge of the laws of heat, may be
briefly stated as branching into five fundamental divisions.
These are: latent heat; specific heat; the conduction
of heat; the radiation of heat; and, finally, the
undulatory theory of heat; by which last, we are gradually
discarding our old material views, and are accustoming
ourselves to look upon heat as simply one of
the forms of force, all of which, such as light, electricity,
magnetism, motion, gravitation, and chemical affinity,
are constantly assuming each other's shape, but, in their
total amount, are incapable either of increase or of diminution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
This grand conception, which is now placing
the indestructibility of force on the same ground as the
indestructibility of matter, has an importance far above
its scientific value, considerable as that undoubtedly is.
For, by teaching us, that nothing perishes, but that, on
the contrary, the slightest movement of the smallest
body, in the remotest region, produces results which
are perpetual, which diffuse themselves through all
space, and which, though they may be metamorphosed,
cannot be destroyed, it impresses us with such an exalted
idea of the regular and compulsory march of physical
affairs, as must eventually influence other and higher
departments of inquiry. Our habits of thought are so
connected and interwoven, that notions of law and of
the necessary concatenation of things, can never be introduced
into one field of speculation, without affecting
other fields which lie contiguous to it. When, therefore,
the modern doctrine of conservation of force,<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
becomes firmly coupled with the older doctrine of conservation
of matter, we may rest assured that the human
mind will not stop there, but will extend to the study
of Man, inferences analogous to those already admitted
in the study of Nature. Having once recognized that
the condition of the material universe, at any one
moment, is simply the result of every thing which has
happened at all preceding moments, and that the most
trivial disturbance would so violate the general scheme,
as to render anarchy inevitable, and that, to sever from
the total mass even the minutest fragment, would, by
dislocating the structure, bury the whole in one common
ruin, we, thus admitting the exquisite adjustment of
the different parts, and discerning, too, in the very
beauty and completeness of the design, the best proof
that it has never been tampered with by the Divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Architect, who called it into being, in whose Omniscience
both the plan, and the issue of the plan, resided
with such clearness and unerring certainty, that not a
stone in that superb and symmetrical edifice has been
touched since the foundation of the edifice was laid,
are, by ascending to this pitch and elevation of thought,
most assuredly advancing towards that far higher step,
which it will remain for our posterity to take, and which
will raise their view to so commanding a height, as to
insure the utter rejection of those old and eminently
irreligious dogmas of supernatural interference with the
affairs of life, which superstition has invented, and ignorance
has bequeathed, and the present acceptance of
which betokens the yet early condition of our knowledge,
the penury of our intellectual resources, and the inveteracy
of the prejudices in which we are still immersed.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, natural, that the physical doctrine of
indestructibility applied to force as well as to matter,
should be essentially a creation of the present century,
notwithstanding a few allusions made to it by some
earlier thinkers, all of whom, however, groped vaguely,
and without general purpose. No preceding age was
bold enough to embrace so magnificent a view as a
whole, nor had any preceding philosophers sufficient
acquaintance with nature to enable them to defend
such a conception, even had they desired to entertain
it. Thus, in the case now before us, it is evident, that
while heat was believed to be material, it could not be
conceived as a force, and therefore no one could grasp
the theory of its metamorphosis into other forces;
though there are passages in Bacon which prove that
he wished to identify it with motion. It was first
necessary to abstract heat into a mere property or
affection of matter, and there was no chance of doing
this until heat was better understood in its immediate
antecedents, that is, until, by the aid of mathematics,
its proximate laws had been generalized. But, with
the single exception of Newton, whose efforts, notwithstanding
his gigantic powers, were, on this subject,
very unsatisfactory, and who, moreover, had a decided
leaning towards the material theory, no one attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
to unravel the mathematical laws of heat till the latter
half of the eighteenth century, when Lambert and
Black began the career which Prevost and Fourier
followed up. The mind, having been so slow in mastering
the preliminaries and outworks of the inquiry,
was not ripe for the far more difficult enterprise of
idealizing heat itself, and so abstracting it, as to strip
it of its material attributes, and leave it to nothing but
the speculative notion of an immaterial force.</p>

<p>From these considerations, which were necessary to
enable the reader to appreciate the value of what was
done in Scotland, it will be seen how essential it was
that the laws of the movement of heat should be
studied before its nature was investigated, and before
the emission theory could be so seriously attacked as to
allow of the possibility of that great doctrine of the
indestructibility of force, which, I make no doubt, is
destined to revolutionize our habits of thought, and to
give to future speculations a basis infinitely wider than
any previously known. In regard to the movements of
heat, we owe the laws of conduction and of radiation
chiefly to France and Geneva, while the laws of specific
heat, and those of latent heat, were discovered in Scotland.
The doctrine of specific heat, though interesting,
has not the scientific importance which belongs to
the other departments of this great subject; but the
doctrine of latent heat is extremely curious, not only in
itself, but also on account of the analogies it suggests
with various branches of physical inquiry.</p>

<p>What is termed latent heat, is exhibited in the following
manner. If, in consequence of the application
of heat, a solid passes into a liquid, as ice, for instance,
into water, the conversion occupies a longer time than
could be explained by any theory which had been propounded
down to the middle of the eighteenth century.
Neither was it possible to explain how it is, that ice
never rises above the temperature of 32° until it is
actually melted, no matter what the heat of the adjacent
bodies may be. There were no means of accounting
for these circumstances. And though practical
men, being familiar with them, did not wonder at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
them, they caused great astonishment among thinkers,
who were accustomed to analyze events, and to seek a
reason for common and every-day occurrences.</p>

<p>Soon after the middle of the eighteenth century,
Black, who was then one of the professors in the University
of Glasgow, turned his attention to this subject.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>
He struck out a theory which, being eminently
original, was violently attacked, but is now generally
admitted. With a boldness and reach of thought not
often equalled, he arrived at the conclusion, that whenever
a body loses some of its consistence, as in the case
of ice becoming water, or water becoming steam, such
body receives an amount of heat which our senses,
though aided by the most delicate thermometer, can
never detect. For, this heat is absorbed; we lose all
sight of it, and it produces no palpable effect on the
material world, but becomes, as it were, a hidden property.
Black, therefore, called it latent heat, because,
though we conceive it as an idea, we cannot trace it as
a fact. The body is, properly speaking, hotter; and
yet its temperature does not rise. Directly, however,
the foregoing process is inverted, that is to say, directly
the steam is condensed into water, or the water hardened
into ice, the heat returns into the world of sense;
it ceases to be latent, and communicates itself to the
surrounding objects. No new heat has been created;
it has, indeed, appeared and disappeared, so far as
our senses are concerned; but our senses were deceived,
since there has, in truth, been neither addition
nor diminution.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> That this remarkable theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
paved the way for the doctrine of the indestructibility
of force, will be obvious to whoever has
examined the manner in which, in the history of the
human mind, scientific conceptions are generated. The
process is always so slow, that no single discovery has
ever been made, except by the united labours of several
successive generations. In estimating, therefore, what
each man has done, we must judge him, not by the
errors he commits, but by the truths he propounds.
Most of his errors are not really his own. He inherits
them from his predecessors; and if he throws some of
them off, we should be grateful, instead of being dissatisfied
that he has not rejected all. Black, no doubt,
fell into the error of regarding heat as a material substance,
which obeys the laws of chemical composition.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>
But this was merely an hypothesis, which was
bequeathed to him, and with which the existing state
of thought forced him to encumber his theory. He
inherited the hypothesis, and could not get rid of his
troublesome possession. The real service which he
rendered is, that, in spite of that hypothesis, which
clung to him to the last, he, far more than any of his
contemporaries, contributed towards the great conception
of idealizing heat, and thus enabled his successors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
to admit it into the class of immaterial and supersensual
forces. Once admitted into that class, the list of forces
became complete; and it was comparatively easy to
apply to the whole body of force, the same notion of
indestructibility, which had previously been applied to
the whole body of matter. But it was hardly possible
to effect this object, while heat stood, as it were, midway
between force and matter, yielding opposite results
to different senses; amenable to the touch, but invisible
to the eye. What was wanting, was to remove it
altogether out of the jurisdiction of the senses, and to
admit that, though we experience its effects, we can
only conceive its existence. Towards accomplishing
this, Black took a prodigious stride. Unconscious,
perhaps, of the remote tendency of his own labours, he
undermined that doctrine of material heat, which he
seemed to support. For, by his advocacy of latent
heat, he taught that its movements constantly baffle,
not only some of our senses, but all of them; and that,
while our feelings make us believe that heat is lost,
our intellect makes us believe that it is not lost. Here,
we have apparent destructibility, and real indestructibility.
To assert that a body received heat without its
temperature rising, was to make the understanding
correct the touch, and defy its dictates. It was a bold
and beautiful paradox, which required courage as well
as insight to broach, and the reception of which marks
an epoch in the human mind, because it was an immense
step towards idealizing matter into force. Some,
indeed, have spoken of invisible matter; but that is a
contradiction in terms, which will never be admitted,
as long as the forms of speech remain unchanged.
Nothing can be invisible, except force, mind, and the
Supreme Cause of all. We must, therefore, ascribe to
Black the signal merit that he first, in the study of
heat, impeached the authority of the senses, and
thereby laid the foundation of every thing which was
afterwards done. Besides the relation which his discovery
bears to the indestructibility of force, it is also
connected with one of the most splendid achievements
effected by this generation in inorganic physics;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
namely, the establishment of the identity of light and
heat. To the senses, light and heat, though in some
respects similar, are in most respects dissimilar. Light,
for instance, affects the eye, and not the touch. Heat
affects the touch, but, under ordinary circumstances,
does not affect the eye. The capital difference, however,
between them is, that heat, unlike light, possesses
the property of temperature; and this property is so
characteristic, that until our understandings are invigorated
by science, we cannot conceive heat separated
from temperature, but are compelled to confuse one
with the other. Directly, however, men began to adopt
the method followed by Black, and were resolved to
consider heat as supersensual, they entered the road
which led to the discovery of light and heat being merely
different developments of the same force. Ignoring the
effects of heat on themselves, or on any part of the
creation, which was capable of feeling its temperature,
and would therefore be deceived by it, nothing was left
for them to do, but to study its effects on the inanimate
world. Then, all was revealed. The career of discovery
was fairly opened; and analogies between light
and heat, which even the boldest imagination had
hardly suspected, were placed beyond a doubt. To
the reflection of heat, which had been formerly known,
were now added the refraction of heat, its double
refraction, its polarization, its depolarization, its circular
polarization, the interference of its rays, and their
retardation; while, what is more remarkable than all,
the march of our knowledge on these points was so
swift, that before the year 1836 had come to a close,
the chain of evidence was completed by the empirical
investigations of Forbes and Melloni, they themselves
little witting that every thing which they accomplished
was prepared before they were born, that they were
but the servants and followers of him who indicated
the path in which they trod, and that their experiments,
ingenious as they were, and full of resource,
were simply the direct practical consequence of one of
those magnificent ideas which Scotland has thrown
upon the world, and the memory of which is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
enough so to bribe the judgment, as to tempt us to
forget, that, while the leading intellects of the nation
were engaged in such lofty pursuits, the nation itself,
untouched by them, passed them over with cold and
contemptuous indifference, being steeped in that deadening
superstition, which turns a deaf ear to every sort
of reason, and will not hearken to the voice of the
charmer, charm he never so wisely.</p>

<p>By thus considering the descent and relationship of
scientific conceptions, we can alone understand what
we really owe to Black's discovery of latent heat. In
regard to the method of the discovery, little need be
said, since every student of the Baconian philosophy
must see, that the discovery was of a kind for which
none of the maxims of that system had provided. As
latent heat escapes the senses, it could not obey the
rules of a philosophy, which grounds all truth on observation
and experiment. The subject of the inquiry
being supersensual, there was no scope for what Bacon
called crucial experiments and separations of nature.
The truth was in the idea; experiments, therefore,
might illustrate it, might bring it up to the surface,
and so enable men to grasp it, but could not prove
it. And this, which appears on the very face of the
discovery, is confirmed by the express testimony of
Dr. Thomson, who knew Black, and was, indeed, one
of the most eminent of his pupils. We are assured by
this unimpeachable witness, that Black, about the year
1759 began to speculate concerning heat; that the
result of those speculations was the theory of latent
heat; that he publicly taught that theory in the year
1761; but that the experiments which were necessary
to convince the world of it were not made till 1764,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>
though, as I need hardly add, according to the inductive
method, it was a breach of all the rules of philosophy
to be satisfied with the theory three years before
the experiments were made, and it was a still greater
breach, not only to be satisfied with it, but to have
openly promulgated it as an original and unquestionable
truth, which explained, in a new manner, the
economy of the material world.</p>

<p>The intellect of Black belonged to a class, which, in
the eighteenth century, was almost universal in Scotland,
but was hardly to be found in England, and which,
for want of a better word, we are compelled to call
deductive, though fully admitting that even the most
deductive minds have in them a large amount of induction,
since, indeed, without induction, the common
business of life could not be carried on. But for the purposes
of scientific classification, we may say, that a man
or an age is deductive, when the favourite process is
reasoning from principles instead of reasoning to them,
and when there is a tendency to underrate the value of
specific experience. That this was the case with the
illustrious discoverer of latent heat, we have seen, both
from the nature of the discovery, and from the decisive
testimony of his friend and pupil. And a further confirmation
may be found in the circumstance, that,
having once propounded his great idea, he, instead of
instituting a long series of laborious experiments, by
which it might be verified in its different branches,
preferred reasoning from it according to the general
maxims of dialectic; pushing it to its logical consequences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
rather than tracking it into regions where the
senses might either confirm or refute it.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> By following
this process of thought, he was led to some beautiful
speculations, which are so remote from experience,
that even now, with all the additional resources of our
knowledge, we cannot tell whether they are true or
false. Of this kind were his views respecting the
causes of the preservation of man, whose existence
would, he thought, be endangered, except for the power
which heat possesses of lying latent and unobserved.
Thus, for example, when a long and severe winter was
followed by sudden warmth, it appeared natural that
the ice and snow should melt with corresponding suddenness;
and if this were to happen, the result would
be such terrible inundations, that it would be hardly
possible for man to escape from their ravages. Even
if he escaped, his works, that is, the material products
of his civilization, would perish. From this catastrophe,
nothing saves him but the latent power of heat. Owing
to this power, directly the ice and snow begin to melt
at their surface, the heat enters their structure, where
a large part of it remains in abeyance, and thus losing
much of its power, the process of liquefaction is arrested.
This dreadful agent is lulled, and becomes
dormant. It is weakened at the outset of its career, and
is laid up, as in a storehouse, from which it can afterwards
emerge, gradually, and with safety to the human
species.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way, as summer advances, a vast magazine of
heat is accumulated, and is preserved in the midst of
water, where it can do man no injury, since, indeed, his
senses are unable to feel it. There the heat remains
buried, until, in the rotation of the seasons, winter
returns, and the waters are congealed into ice. In the
process of congelation, that treasury of heat, which had
been hidden all the summer, reappears; it ceases to be
latent; and now, for the first time, striking the senses
of man, it tempers, on his behalf, the severity of winter.
The faster the water freezes, the faster the heat is disengaged;
so that, by virtue of this great law of nature,
cold actually generates warmth, and the inclemency of
every season, though it cannot be hindered, is softened
in proportion as the inclemency is more threatening.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>Thus, again, inasmuch as heat becomes latent, and
flies from the senses, not only when ice is passing into
water, but also when water is passing into steam, we
find in this latter circumstance, one of the reasons why
man and other animals can live in the tropics, which,
but for this, would be deserted. They are constantly
suffering from the heat which is collected in their
bodies, and which, considered by itself, is enough to
destroy them. But this heat causes thirst, and they
consequently swallow great quantities of fluid, much of
which exudes through the pores of the skin in the form
of vapour. And as, according to the theory of latent
heat, vapour cannot be produced without a vast amount
of heat being buried within it, such vapour absorbs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
carries off from the body, that which, if left in the
system, would prove fatal. To this we must add, that,
in the tropics, the evaporation of water is necessarily
rapid, and the vapour which is thus produced, becomes
another storehouse of heat, and a vehicle by which it
is removed from the earth, and prevented from unduly
interfering with the economy of life.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<p>From these and many other arguments, all of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
were so essentially speculative, and dealt with such
hidden processes of nature, that even now we are not
justified either in confidently admitting them or in
positively denying them, Black was led to that great
doctrine of the indestructibility of heat,<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> which, as I
have pointed out, has, in its connexion with the indestructibility
of force, a moral and social importance
even superior to its scientific value. Though the
evidence of which he was possessed was far more scanty
than what we now have, he, by the reach of his commanding
intellect, rather than by the number and
accuracy of his facts, became so penetrated with a conviction
of the stability of physical affairs, that he not
only applied that idea to the subtle phenomena of heat,
but, what was much harder to do, he applied it to cases
in which heat so entirely escapes the senses, that man
has no cognizance of it, except through the medium of
the imagination. According to his view, heat passes
through an immense variety of changes, during which
it appears to be lost; changes which no eye can ever
see, which no touch can ever experience, and which no
instrument can ever measure. Still, and in the midst
of all these changes, it remains intact. From it nothing
can be taken, and to it nothing can be added. In one
of those fine passages of his Lectures, which, badly
reported as they are,<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> bear the impress of his elevated
genius, Black, after stating what would probably
happen, if the total amount of heat existing in the
world were to be diminished, proceeds to speculate on
the consequences of its being increased. Were it possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
for any power to add to it ever so little, it would
at once overstep its bounds; the equilibrium would be
disturbed; the framework of affairs would be disjointed.
The evil rapidly increasing, and acting with
accumulated force, nothing would be able to stop its
ravages. It must continue to gain ground, till all other
principles are absorbed and conquered. Sweeping on,
unhindered, and irresistible, before it, every animal
must perish, the whole vegetable world must disappear,
the waters must pass into vapour, and the solid parts
of the globe be merged and melted, until, at length,
the glorious fabric, loosened and dissolved, would fall
away, and return to that original chaos out of which it
had been evolved.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>These, like many other of the speculations of this
great thinker, will find small favour with those purely
inductive philosophers, who not only suppose, perhaps
rightly, that all our knowledge is in its beginning built
upon facts, but who countenance, what seems to me,
the very dangerous opinion, that every increase of
knowledge must be preceded by an increase of facts.
To such men it will appear, that Black had far better
have occupied himself in making new observations, or
devising new experiments, than in thus indulging his
imagination in wild and unprofitable dreams. They
will think, that these flights of fancy are suitable, indeed,
to the poet, but unworthy of that severe accuracy,
and of that close attention to facts, which ought to
characterize a philosopher. In England, especially,
there is, among physical inquirers, an avowed determination
to separate philosophy from poetry, and to
look upon them, not only as different, but as hostile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Among that class of thinkers, whose zeal and ability
are beyond all praise, and to whom we owe almost unbounded
obligations, there does undoubtedly exist a
very strong opinion, that, in their own pursuit, the
imagination is extremely dangerous, as leading to
speculations, of which the basis is not yet assured, and
generating a desire to catch too eagerly at distant
glimpses before the intermediate ground has been traversed.
That the imagination has this tendency is
undeniable. But they who object to it on this account,
and who would, therefore, divorce poetry from philosophy,
have, I apprehend, taken a too limited view of
the functions of the human mind, and of the manner
in which truth is obtained. There is, in poetry, a
divine and prophetic power, and an insight into the
turn and aspect of things, which, if properly used,
would make it the ally of science instead of the enemy.
By the poet, nature is contemplated on the side of the
emotions; by the man of science, on the side of the
understanding. But the emotions are as much a part
of us as the understanding: they are as truthful; they
are as likely to be right. Though their view is different,
it is not capricious. They obey fixed laws; they
follow an orderly and uniform course; they run in
sequences; they have their logic and method of inference.
Poetry, therefore, is a part of philosophy, simply
because the emotions are a part of the mind. If the
man of science despises their teaching, so much the
worse for him. He has only half his weapons; his
arsenal is unfilled. Conquests, indeed, he may make,
because his native strength may compensate the defects
of his equipment. But his success would be more
complete and more rapid, if he were properly furnished
and made ready for the battle. And I cannot but regard
as the worst intellectual symptom of this great
country, what I must venture to call the imperfect
education of physical philosophers, as exhibited both in
their writings and in their trains of thought. This is
the more serious, because they, as a body, form the
most important class in England, whether we look at
their ability, or at the benefits we have received from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
them, or at the influence they are exercising, and are
likely to exercise, over the progress of society. It cannot,
however, be concealed, that they display an inordinate
respect for experiments, an undue love of minute
detail, and a disposition to overrate the inventors of
new instruments, and the discoverers of new, but often
insignificant, facts. Their predecessors of the seventeenth
century, by using hypotheses more boldly, and
by indulging their imagination more frequently, did
certainly effect greater things, in comparison with the
then state of knowledge, than our contemporaries, with
much superior resources, have been able to achieve.
The magnificent generalizations of Newton and Harvey
could never have been completed in an age absorbed in
one unvarying round of experiments and observations.
We are in that predicament, that our facts have outstripped
our knowledge, and are now encumbering its
march. The publications of our scientific institutions,
and of our scientific authors, overflow with minute and
countless details, which perplex the judgment, and
which no memory can retain. In vain do we demand
that they should be generalized, and reduced into order.
Instead of that, the heap continues to swell. We want
ideas, and we get more facts. We hear constantly of
what nature is doing, but we rarely hear of what man is
thinking. Owing to the indefatigable industry of this and
the preceding century, we are in possession of a huge
and incoherent mass of observations, which have been
stored up with great care, but which, until they are
connected by some presiding idea, will be utterly useless.
The most effective way of turning them to account,
would be to give more scope to the imagination,
and incorporate the spirit of poetry with the spirit of
science. By this means, our philosophers would double
their resources, instead of working, as now, maimed,
and with only half their nature. They fear the imagination,
on account of its tendency to form hasty
theories. But, surely, all our faculties are needed in
the pursuit of truth, and we cannot be justified in discrediting
any part of the human mind. And I can
hardly doubt, that one of the reasons why we, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
England, made such wonderful discoveries during the
seventeenth century, was because that century was also
the great age of English poetry. The two mightiest
intellects our country has produced are Shakspeare
and Newton; and that Shakspeare should have preceded
Newton, was, I believe, no casual or unmeaning
event. Shakspeare and the poets sowed the seed,
which Newton and the philosophers reaped. Discarding
the old scholastic and theological pursuits, they drew
attention to nature, and thus became the real founders
of all natural science. They did even more than this.
They first impregnated the mind of England with bold
and lofty conceptions. They taught the men of their
generation to crave after the unseen. They taught
them to pine for the ideal, and to rise above the visible
world of sense. In this way, by cultivating the
emotions, they opened one of the paths which lead to
truth. The impetus which they communicated, survived
their own day, and, like all great movements,
was felt in every department of thought. But now it
is gone; and, unless I am greatly mistaken, physical
science is at present suffering from its absence. Since
the seventeenth century, we have had no poet of the
highest order, though Shelley, had he lived, would
perhaps have become one. He had something of that
burning passion, that sacred fire, which kindles the
soul, as though it came fresh from the altar of the
gods. But he was cut off in his early prime, when his
splendid genius was still in its dawn. If we except his
immature, though marvellous, efforts, we may assuredly
say, that, for nearly two hundred years, England has
produced no poetry which bears those unmistakable
marks of inspiration which we find in Spenser, in
Shakspeare, and in Milton. The result is, that we,
separated by so long an interval from those great
feeders of the imagination, who nurtured our ancestors,
and being unable to enter fully into the feelings of
poets, who wrote when nearly all opinions, and, therefore,
nearly all forms of emotion, were very different to
what they now are, cannot possibly sympathize with
those immortal productions so closely as their contemporaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
did. The noble English poetry of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries is read more than ever, but
it does not colour our thoughts; it does not shape our
understandings, as it shaped the understandings of our
forefathers. Between us and them is a chasm, which
we cannot entirely bridge. We are so far removed from
the associations amid which those poems were composed,
that they do not flash upon us with that reality
and distinctness of aim, which they would have done,
had we lived when they were written. Their garb is
strange, and belongs to another time. Not merely
their dialect and their dress, but their very complexion
and their inmost sentiments, tell of bygone days, of
which we have no firm hold. There is, no doubt, a
certain ornamental culture, which the most highly
educated persons receive from the literature of the past,
and by which they sometimes refine their taste, and
sometimes enlarge their ideas. But the real culture of
a great people, that which supplies each generation
with its principal strength, consists of what is learnt
from the generation immediately preceding. Though
we are often unconscious of the process, we build nearly
all our conceptions on the basis recognized by those
who went just before us. Our closest contact is, not
with our forefathers, but with our fathers. To them
we are linked by a genuine affinity, which, being spontaneous,
costs us no effort, and from which, indeed, we
cannot escape. We inherit their notions, and modify
them, just as they modified the notions of their predecessors.
At each successive modification, something
is lost and something is gained, until, at length, the
original type almost disappears. Therefore it is, that
ideas entertained several generations ago, bear about
the same relation to us, as ideas preserved in a foreign
literature. In both cases, the ideas may adorn our
knowledge, but they are never so thoroughly incorporated
with our minds, as to be the knowledge itself.
The assimilation is incomplete, because the sympathy
is incomplete. We have now no great poets; and our
poverty in this respect is not compensated by the fact,
that we once had them, and that we may, and do, read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
their works. The movement has gone by; the charm
is broken; the bond of union, though not cancelled, is
seriously weakened. Hence, our age, great as it is, and,
in nearly all respects, greater than any the world has
yet seen, has, notwithstanding its large and generous
sentiments, its unexampled toleration, its love of liberty,
and its profuse, and almost reckless, charity, a certain
material, unimaginative, and unheroic character, which
has made several observers tremble for the future.
So far as I can understand our present condition, I do
not participate in these fears, because I believe that the
good we have already gained, is beyond all comparison
greater than what we have lost. But that something
has been lost, is unquestionable. We have lost much
of that imagination, which, though, in practical life, it
often misleads, is, in speculative life, one of the highest
of all qualities, being suggestive as well as creative.
Even practically, we should cherish it, because the
commerce of the affections mainly depends on it. It
is, however, declining; while, at the same time, the
increasing refinement of society accustoms us more and
more to suppress our emotions, lest they should be
disagreeable to others. And as the play of the
emotions is the chief study of the poet, we see, in this
circumstance, another reason which makes it difficult
to rival that great body of poetry which our ancestors
possessed. Therefore, it is doubly incumbent on physical
philosophers to cultivate the imagination. It is a
duty they owe to their own pursuits, which would be
enriched and invigorated by such an enlargement of
their resources. It is also a duty which they owe to
society in general; since they, whose intellectual influence
is already greater than that of any other class, and
whose authority is perceptibly on the increase, might
have power enough to correct the most serious deficiency
of the present age, and to make us some amends
for our inability to produce such a splendid imaginative
literature as that which our forefathers created, and in
which the choicest spirits of the seventeenth century
did, if I may so say, dwell and have their being.</p>

<p>If, therefore, Black had done nothing more than set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
the example of a great physical philosopher giving free
scope to the imagination, he would have conferred
upon us a boon, the magnitude of which it is not easy
to overrate. And it is very remarkable, that, before he
died, that department of inorganic physics, which he
cultivated with such success, was taken up by another
eminent Scotchman, who pursued exactly the same
plan, though with somewhat inferior genius. I allude,
of course, to Leslie, whose researches on heat are well
known to those who are occupied with this subject;
while, for our present purpose, they are chiefly interesting
as illustrating that peculiar method which, in the
eighteenth century, seemed essential to the Scotch mind.</p>

<p>About thirty years after Black propounded his famous
theory of heat, Leslie began to investigate the
same topic, and, in 1804, published a special dissertation
upon it.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> In that work, and in some papers in his
<i>Treatises on Philosophy</i>, are contained his views, several
of which are now known to be inaccurate,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> though
some are of sufficient value to mark an epoch in the
history of science. Such was his generalization respecting
the connexion between the radiation of heat, and
its reflection; bodies which reflect it most, radiating it
least, and those which radiate it most, reflecting it
least. Such, too, was another wide conclusion, which
the best inquirers have since confirmed, namely, that,
while heat is radiating from a body, the intensity of
each ray is as the sine of the angle which it makes
with the surface of that body.</p>

<p>These were important steps, and they were the
result of experiments, preceded by large and judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
hypotheses. In relation, however, to the economy of
nature, considered as a whole, they are of small account
in comparison with what Leslie effected towards consolidating
the great idea of light and heat being identical,
and thus preparing his contemporaries for that theory
of the interchange of forces, which is the capital intellectual
achievement of the nineteenth century. But
it is interesting to observe, that, with all his ardour,
he could not go beyond a certain length. He was so
hampered by the material tendencies of his time, that
he could not bring himself to conceive heat as a purely
supersensual force, of which temperature was the external
manifestation.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> For this, the age was barely ripe.
We accordingly find him asserting, that heat is an
elastic fluid, extremely subtle, but still a fluid.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> His
real merit was, that, notwithstanding the difficulties
which beset his path, he firmly seized the great truth,
that there is no fundamental difference between light
and heat. As he puts it, each is merely a metamorphosis
of the other. Heat is light in complete repose.
Light is heat in rapid motion. Directly light is combined
with a body, it becomes heat; but when it is
thrown off from that body, it again becomes light.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>Whether this is true or false, we cannot tell; and
many years, perhaps many generations, will have to
elapse before we shall be able to tell. But the service
rendered by Leslie is quite independent of the accuracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
of his opinion, as to the manner in which light and heat
are interchanged. That they are interchanged, is the
essential and paramount idea. And we must remember,
that he made this idea the basis of his researches, at a
period when some very important facts, or, I should
rather say, some very conspicuous facts, were opposed
to it; while the main facts which favoured it were still
unknown. When he composed his work, the analogies
between light and heat, with which we are now acquainted,
had not been discovered; no one being aware,
that double refraction, polarization, and other curious
properties, are common to both. To grasp so wide a
truth in the face of such obstacles, was a rare stroke of
sagacity. But, on account of the obstacles, the inductive
mind of England refused to receive the truth, as it was
not generalized from a survey of all the facts. And
Leslie, unfortunately for himself, died too soon to enjoy
the exquisite pleasure of witnessing the empirical corroboration
of his doctrine by direct experiment, although
he clearly perceived that the march of discovery, in
reference to polarization, was leading the scientific
world to a point, of which his keen eye had discerned
the nature, when, to others, it was an almost invisible
speck, dim in the distant offing.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the method adopted by Leslie, he assures
us, that, in assuming the principles from which
he reasoned, he derived great aid from poetry; for he
knew that the poets are, after their own manner, consummate
observers, and that their united observations
form a treasury of truths, which are nowise inferior to
the truths of science, and of which science must either
avail herself, or else suffer from neglecting them.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
apply these truths rightly, and to fit them to the
exigencies of physical inquiry, is, no doubt, a most difficult
task, since it involves nothing less than holding
the balance between the conflicting claims of the emotions
and the understanding. Like all great enterprises,
it is full of danger, and, if undertaken by an
ordinary mind, would certainly fail. But there are two
circumstances which make it less dangerous in our
time, than in any earlier period. The first circumstance
is, that the supremacy of the human understanding,
and its right to judge all theories for itself, is now more
generally admitted than ever; so that there can be
little fear of our leaning to the opposite side, and
allowing poetry to encroach on science. The other
circumstance is, that our knowledge of the laws of
nature is much greater than that possessed by any
previous age; and there is, consequently, less risk of
the imagination leading us into error, inasmuch as we
have a large number of well-ascertained truths, which
we can confront with every speculation, no matter how
plausible or ingenious it may appear.</p>

<p>On both these grounds, Leslie was, I apprehend,
justified in taking the course which he did. At all
events, it is certain, that, by following it, he came
nearer than would otherwise have been possible, to the
conceptions of the most advanced scientific thinkers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
of our day. He distinctly recognized that, in the
material world, there is neither break nor pause; so
that what we call the divisions of nature have no
existence, except in our minds.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> He was even
almost prepared to do away with that imaginary difference
between the organic and inorganic world, which
still troubles many of our physicists, and prevents them
from comprehending the unity and uninterrupted march
of affairs. They, with their old notions of inanimate
matter, are unable to see that all matter is living, and
that what we term death is a mere expression by which
we signify a fresh form of life. Towards this conclusion,
all our knowledge is now converging; and it is
certainly no small merit in Leslie, that he, sixty years
ago, when really comprehensive views, embracing the
whole creation, were scarcely known among scientific
men, should have strongly insisted that all forces are of
the same kind, and that we have no right to distinguish
between them, as if some were living, and others were
dead.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>We owe much to him, by whom such views were
advocated. But they were then, and in a certain,
though far smaller degree, they are now, so out of the
domain of physical experience, that Leslie never could
have obtained them by generalizing in the way which
the inductive philosophy enjoins. His great work on
heat was executed, as well as conceived, on the opposite
plan;<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> and his prejudices on this point were so strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
that we are assured by his biographer, that he would
allow no merit to Bacon, who organized the inductive
method into a system, and to whose authority we in
England pay a willing, and I had almost said a servile,
homage.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>Another curious illustration of the skill with which
the Scotch mind, when once possessed of a principle,
worked from it deductively, appears in the geological
speculations of Hutton, late in the eighteenth century.
It is well known, that the two great powers which have
altered the condition of our planet, and made it what it
is, are fire and water. Each has played so considerable
a part, that we can hardly measure their relative importance.
Judging, however, from the present appearance
of the crust of the earth, there is reason to believe,
that the older rocks are chiefly the result of fusion, and
that the younger are aqueous deposits. It is, therefore,
not unlikely, that, in the order in which the energies of
nature have unfolded themselves, fire preceded water,
and was its necessary precursor.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> But, all that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
are as yet justified in asserting is, that these two
causes, the igneous and the aqueous, were in full operation
long before man existed, and are still busily working.
Perhaps they are preparing another change in our
habitation, suitable to new forms of life, as superior to
man, as man is superior to the beings who occupied the
earth before his time. Be this as it may, fire and water
are the two most important and most general principles
with which geologists are concerned; and though, on
a superficial view, each is extremely destructive, it is
certain that they can really destroy nothing, but can
only decompose and recompose; shifting the arrangements
of nature, but leaving nature herself intact.
Whether one of these elements will ever again get the
upper hand of its opponent, is a speculation of extreme
interest. For, there is reason to suspect, that, at one
period, fire was more active than water, and that, at
another period, water was more active than fire. That
they are engaged in incessant warfare, is a fact with
which geologists are perfectly familiar, though, in this, as
in many other cases, the poets were the first to discern the
truth. To the eye of the geologist, water is constantly
labouring to reduce all the inequalities of the earth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
a single level; while fire, with its volcanic action, is
equally busy in restoring those inequalities, by throwing
up matter to the surface, and in various ways disturbing
the crust of the globe.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> And as the beauty of the
material world mainly depends on that irregularity of
aspect, without which scenery would have presented no
variety of form, and but little variety of colour, we
shall, I think, not be guilty of too refined a subtlety, if
we say that fire, by saving us from the monotony to
which water would have condemned us, has been the
remote cause of that development of the imagination
which has given us our poetry, our painting, and our
sculpture, and has thereby not only wonderfully increased
the pleasures of life, but has imparted to the
human mind a completeness of function, to which, in
the absence of such a stimulus, it could not have
attained.</p>

<p>When geologists began to study the laws according
to which fire and water had altered the structure of the
earth, two different courses were open to them, namely,
the inductive and the deductive. The deductive plan
was to compute the probable consequences of fire and
water, by reasoning from the sciences of thermotics
and hydrodynamics; tracking each element by an independent
line of argument, and afterwards coördinating
into a single scheme the results which had been separately
obtained. It would then only remain to inquire,
how far this imaginary scheme harmonized with the
actual state of things; and if the discrepancy between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the ideal and the actual were not greater than might
fairly be expected from the perturbations produced by
other causes, the ratiocination would be complete, and
geology would, in its inorganic department, become a
deductive science. That our knowledge is ripe for
such a process, I am far, indeed, from supposing; but
this is the path which a deductive mind would take, so
far as it was able. On the other hand, an inductive
mind, instead of beginning with fire and water, would
begin with the effects which fire and water had produced,
and would first study these two agents, not in
their own separate sciences, but in their united action
as exhibited on the crust of the earth. An inquirer of
this sort would assume, that the best way of arriving
at truth would be to proceed from effects to causes,
observing what had actually happened, and rising
from the complex results up to a knowledge of the
simple agents, by whose power the results have been
brought about.</p>

<p>If the reader has followed the train of thought
which I have endeavoured to establish in this chapter,
and in the first volume, he will be prepared to
expect that when, in the latter half of the eighteenth
century, geology was first seriously studied, the
inductive plan of proceeding from effects to causes
became the favourite one in England; while the deductive
plan of proceeding from causes to effects, was
adopted in Scotland and in Germany. And such was
really the case. It is generally admitted, that, in
England, scientific geology owes its origin to William
Smith, whose mind was singularly averse to system,
and who, believing that the best way of understanding
former causes was to study present effects, occupied
himself, between the years 1790 and 1815, in a laborious
examination of different strata.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> In 1815, he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
after traversing the whole of England on foot, published
the first complete geological map which ever
appeared, and thus took the first great step towards
accumulating the materials for an inductive generalization.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>
In 1807, and, therefore, before he had brought
his arduous task to an end, there was formed in London
the Geological Society, the express object of which, we
are assured, was, to observe the condition of the earth,
but by no means to generalize the causes which had
produced that condition.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> The resolution was, perhaps,
a wise one. At all events, it was highly characteristic
of the sober and patient spirit of the English
intellect. With what energy and unsparing toil it has
been executed, and how the most eminent members of
the Geological Society have, in the pursuit of truth,
not only explored every part of Europe, but examined
the shell of the earth in America and in Northern Asia,
is well known to all who are interested in these matters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
nor can it be denied, that the great works of Lyell and
Murchison prove that the men who are capable of
such laborious enterprises, are also capable of the still
more difficult achievement of generalizing their facts
and refining them into ideas. They did not go as
mere observers, but they went with the noble object
of making their observations subservient to a discovery
of the laws of nature. That was their aim; and all
honour be to them for it. Still, it is evident, that
their process is essentially inductive; it is a procedure
from the observation of complex phenomena, up to the
elements to which those phenomena are owing; it is,
in other words, a study of natural effects, in order to
learn the operation of natural causes.</p>

<p>Very different was the process in Germany and
Scotland. In 1787, that is, only three years before
William Smith began his labours, Werner, by his work
on the classification of mountains, laid the foundation
of the German school of geology.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> His influence
was immense; and among his pupils we find the names
of Mohs, Raumer, and Von Buch, and even that of
Alexander Humboldt.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> But the geological theory
which he propounded, depended entirely on a chain of
argument from cause to effect. He assumed, that all
the great changes through which the earth had passed,
were due to the action of water. Taking this for
granted, he reasoned deductively from premisses with
which his knowledge of water supplied him. Without
entering into details respecting his system, it is enough
to say, that, according to it, there was originally one
vast and primeval sea, which, in the course of time,
deposited the primitive rocks. The base of all was
granite; then gneiss; and others followed in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
order. In the bosom of the water, which at first
was tranquil, agitations gradually arose, which, destroying
part of the earliest deposits, gave birth to new
rocks, formed out of their ruins. The stratified thus
succeeded to the unstratified, and something like
variety was established. Then came another period,
in which the face of the waters, instead of being merely
agitated, was convulsed by tempests, and, amid their
play and collision, life was generated, and plants and
animals sprung into existence. The vast solitude was
slowly peopled, the sea gradually retired; and a foundation
was laid for that epoch, during which man entered
the scene, bringing with him the rudiments of
order and of social improvement.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a></p>

<p>These were the leading views of a system which, we
must remember, exercised great sway in the scientific
world, and won over to its side minds of considerable
power. Erroneous and far-fetched though it was, it
had the merit of calling attention to one of the two
chief principles which have determined the present
condition of our planet. It had the further merit of
provoking a controversy, which was eminently serviceable
to the interests of truth. For, the great enemy
of knowledge is not error, but inertness. All that we
want is discussion, and then we are sure to do well, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
matter what our blunders may be. One error conflicts
with another; each destroys its opponent, and truth is
evolved. This is the course of the human mind, and
it is from this point of view that the authors of new
ideas, the proposers of new contrivances, and the originators
of new heresies, are benefactors of their
species. Whether they are right or wrong, is the least
part of the question. They tend to excite the mind;
they open up the faculties; they stimulate us to fresh
inquiry; they place old subjects under new aspects;
they disturb the public sloth; and they interrupt,
rudely, but with most salutary effect, that love of
routine, which, by inducing men to go grovelling on
in the ways of their ancestors, stands in the path of
every improvement, as a constant, an outlying, and,
too often, a fatal obstacle.</p>

<p>The method adopted by Werner was evidently deductive,
since he argued from a supposed cause, and
reasoned from it to the effects. In that cause, he
found his major premiss, and thence he worked downwards
to his conclusion, until he reached the world of
sense and of reality. He trusted in his one great idea,
and he handled that idea with consummate skill. On
that very account, did he pay less attention to existing
facts. Had he chosen, he, like other men, could have
collected them, and subjected them to an inductive
generalization. But he preferred the opposite path.
To reproach him with this is irrational; for, in his
journey after truth, he chose one of the only two roads
which are open to the human mind. In England, indeed,
we are apt to take for granted that one road is
infinitely preferable to the other. It may be so; but
on this, as on many other subjects, assertions are current
which have never been proved. At all events,
Werner was so satisfied with his method, that he would
not be at the pains of examining the position of rocks
and their strata, as they are variously exhibited in
different countries; he did not even explore his own
country, but, confining himself to a corner of Germany,
he began and completed his celebrated system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
without investigating the facts on which, according to
the inductive method, that system should have been
built.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>Exactly the same process, on the same subject, and
at the same time, was going on in Scotland. Hutton,
who was the founder of Scotch geology, and who, in
1788, published his <i>Theory of the Earth</i>, conducted the
inquiry just as Werner did; though, when he began
his speculations, he had no knowledge of what Werner
was doing.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> The only difference between them was,
that while Werner reasoned from the agency of water,
Hutton reasoned from the agency of fire. The cause
of this may, I think, be explained. Hutton lived in a
country where some of the most important laws of
heat had, for the first time, been generalized, and where
consequently, that department of inorganic physics had
acquired great reputation. It was natural for a Scotchman
to take more than ordinary interest in a subject
in which Scotland had been so successful, and had obtained
so much fame. We need not, therefore, wonder
that Hutton, who, like all men, felt the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
bent of the time in which he lived, should have yielded
to an influence of which he was, perhaps, unconscious.
In obedience to the general mental habits of his country
he adopted the deductive method. In further
obedience to the more special circumstances connected
with his own immediate pursuits, he gathered the
principles from which he reasoned from a study of fire,
instead of gathering them, as Werner did, from a study
of water.</p>

<p>Hence it is, that, in the history of geology, the followers
of Werner are known as Neptunists, and those of
Hutton as Plutonists.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> And these terms represent the
only difference between the two great masters. In the
most important points, namely their method, they were
entirely agreed. Both were essentially one-sided; both
paid a too exclusive attention to one of the two principal
agents which have altered, and are still altering,
the crust of the earth; both reasoned from those agents,
instead of reasoning to them; and both constructed
their system without sufficiently studying the actual and
existing facts; committing, in this respect, an error
which the English geologists were the first to rectify.</p>

<p>As I am writing a history, not of science, but of
scientific method, I can only briefly glance at the
nature of those services which Hutton rendered to
geology, and which are so considerable, that his system
has been called its present basis.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> This, however, is
too strongly expressed; for, though Hutton was far
from denying the influence of water,<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> he did not
concede enough to it, and there is a tendency among
several geologists to admit that the system of Werner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
considered as an aqueous theory, contains a larger
amount of truth than the advocates of the igneous
theory are willing to allow. Still, what Hutton did
was most remarkable, especially in reference to what
are now termed metamorphic rocks, the theory of
whose formation he was the first to conceive.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> Into
this, and into their connexion, on the one hand, with
the sedimentary rocks, and, on the other hand, with
those rocks whose origin is perhaps purely igneous, I
could not enter without treading on debatable ground.
But, putting aside what is yet uncertain, I will mention
two circumstances respecting Hutton which are undisputed,
and which will give some idea of his method,
and of the turn of his mind. The first circumstance is,
that, although he ascribed to subterranean heat, as exhibited
in volcanic action, a greater and more constant
energy than any previous inquirers had ventured to
do,<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> he preferred speculating on the probable consequences
of that action, rather than drawing inferences
from the facts which the action presented; he being on
this point so indifferent, that he arrived at his conclusions
without inspecting even a single region of active
volcanoes, where he might have watched the workings
of nature, and seen what she was really about.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
other circumstance is equally characteristic. Hutton, in
his speculations concerning the geological effects of heat,
naturally availed himself of the laws which Black had
unfolded. One of those laws was, that certain earths
owe their fusibility to the presence of fixed air in
them before heat has expelled it; so that if it were
possible to force them to retain their fixed air, or carbonic
acid gas, as we now call it, no amount of heat
could deprive them of the capability of being fused.
The fertile mind of Hutton saw, in this discovery, a
principle from which he could construct a geological
argument. It occurred to him, that great pressure
would prevent the escape of fixed air from heated
rocks, and would thus enable them to be fused, notwithstanding
their elevated temperature. He then
supposed that, at a period anterior to the existence of
man, such a process had taken place under the surface
of the sea, and that the weight of so great a column of
water had prevented the rocks from being decomposed
while they were subjected to the action of fire. In this
way, their volatile parts were held together, and they
themselves might be melted, which could not have happened
except for this enormous pressure. By following
this line of argument, he accounted for the consolidation
of strata by heat; since, according to the premisses from
which he started, the oily, or bituminous parts, would
remain, in spite of the efforts of heat to disperse
them.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> This striking speculation led to the inference,
that the volatile components of a substance, and
its fixed components, may be made to cohere, in the
very teeth of that apparently irresistible agent whose
business it is to effect their separation. Such an inference
was contrary to all experience; or, to say the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
least, no man had ever seen an instance of it.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> Indeed,
the event was only supposed to happen in consequence
of circumstances which were never met with
on the surface of the globe, and which, therefore, were
out of the range of all human observation.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> The
utmost that could be expected was, that, by means of
our instruments, we might, perhaps, on a small scale,
imitate the process which Hutton had imagined. It
was possible, that a direct experiment might artificially
combine great pressure with great heat, and that the
result might be, that the senses would realize what the
intellect had conceived.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> But the experiment had
never been tried, and Hutton, who delighted in reasoning
from ideas rather than from facts, was not likely to
undertake it.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> He cast his speculation on the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
and left it to its fate.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Fortunately, however, for the
reception of his system, a very ingenious and skilful
experimenter of that day, Sir James Hall, determined to
test the speculation by an appeal to facts; and as nature
did not supply the facts which he wanted, he created
them for himself. He applied heat to powdered chalk,
while, at the same time, with great delicacy of manipulation,
he subjected the chalk to a pressure about equal
to the weight of a column of water half a mile high.
The result was, that, under that pressure, the volatile
parts of the chalk were held together; the carbonic
acid gas was unable to escape; the generation of
quicklime was stopped; the ordinary operations of nature
were baffled, and the whole composition, being preserved
in its integrity, was fused, and, on subsequently
cooling, actually crystallized into solid marble.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Never was triumph more complete. Never did a fact
more fully confirm an idea.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> But, in the mind of
Hutton, the idea preceded the fact by a long interval;
since, before the fact was known, the theory had been
raised, and the system which was built upon it had,
indeed, been published several years. It, therefore,
appears that one of the chief parts of the Huttonian
Theory, and certainly its most successful part, was
conceived in opposition to all preceding experience;
that it pre-supposed a combination of events which no
one had ever observed, and the mere possibility of
which nothing but artificial experiment could prove;
and, finally, that Hutton was so confident of the validity
of his own method of inquiry, that he disdained
to make the experiment himself, but left to another
mind that empirical branch of the investigation which
he deemed of little moment, but which we, in England,
are taught to believe is the only safe foundation of
physical research.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>I have now given an account of all the most important
discoveries made by Scotland, in the eighteenth
century, respecting the laws of the inorganic world. I
have said nothing of Watt, because, although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
steam-engine, which we owe to him, is of incalculable
importance, it is not a discovery, but an invention. An
invention it may justly be termed, rather than an improvement.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
Notwithstanding what had been effected
in the seventeenth century, by De Caus, Worcester,
Papin, and Savery, and notwithstanding the later additions
of Newcomen and others, the real originality of
Watt is unimpeachable. His engine was, essentially, a
new invention; but, under its scientific aspect, it was
merely a skilful adaptation of laws previously known;
and one of its most important points, namely, the
economy of heat, was a practical application of ideas
promulgated by Black.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> The only discovery made by
Watt, was that of the composition of water. Though his
claims are disputed by the friends of Cavendish, it would
appear that he was the first who ascertained that water,
instead of being an element, is a compound of two
gases.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> This discovery was a considerable step in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
history of chemical analysis, but it neither involved nor
suggested any new law of nature, and has, therefore,
no claim to mark an epoch in the history of the human
mind.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> There is, however, one circumstance connected
with it which is too characteristic to be passed over in
silence. The discovery was made in 1783, by Watt, the
Scotchman, and by Cavendish, the Englishman, neither
of whom seems to have been aware of what the other
was doing.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> But between the two there was this
difference. Watt, for several years previously, had been
speculating on the subject of water in connexion with
air, and having, by Black's law of latent heat, associated
them together, he was prepared to believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
one is convertible into the other.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> The idea of an
intimate analogy between the two bodies having once
entered his mind, gradually ripened; and when he, at
last, completed the discovery, it was merely by reasoning
from data which others possessed besides himself.
Instead of bringing to light new facts, he drew new
conclusions from former ideas.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> Cavendish, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
other hand, obtained his result by the method natural
to an Englishman. He did not venture to draw a
fresh inference, until he had first ascertained some
fresh facts. Indeed, his discovery was so completely
an induction from his own experiments, that he omitted
to take into consideration the theory of latent heat,
from which Watt had reasoned, and where that eminent
Scotchman had found the premisses of his argument.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>
Both of these great inquirers arrived at truth, but each
accomplished his journey by a different path. And
this antithesis is accurately expressed by one of the
most celebrated of living chemists, who, in his remarks
on the composition of water, truly says, that while
Cavendish established the facts, Watt established the
idea.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p>Thus much, as to what was effected by the Scotch
in the department of inorganic science. If we now
turn to organic science, we shall find that, there also,
their labours were very remarkable. To those who are
capable of a certain elevation and compass of thought,
it will appear, in the highest degree, probable, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
between the organic and inorganic world, there is no
real difference. That they are separated, as is commonly
asserted, by a sharp line of demarcation, which
indicates where one abruptly ends, and the other
abruptly begins, seems to be a supposition altogether
untenable. Nature does not pause, and break off in
this fitful and irregular manner. In her works there
is neither gap nor chasm. To a really scientific mind,
the material world presents one vast and uninterrupted
series, gradually rising from the lowest to the highest
forms, but never stopping. In one part of that series,
we find a particular structure, which, so far as our
observations have yet extended, we, in another part,
cannot find. We also observe particular functions,
which correspond to the structure, and, as we believe,
result from it. This is all we know. Yet, from these
scanty facts, we, who, at present, are still in the infancy
of knowledge, and have but skimmed the surface of
things, are expected to infer, that there must be a
point, in the chain of existence, where both structure
and function suddenly cease, and, after which, we may
vainly search for signs of life. It would be difficult to
conceive a conclusion more repugnant to the whole
march and analogy of modern thought. In every department,
the speculations of the greatest thinkers are
constantly tending to coördinate all phenomena, and to
regard them as different, indeed, in degree, but by no
means as different in kind. Formerly, men were content
to ground their conviction of this difference in
kind, on the evidence of the eye, which, on a cursory
inspection, saw an organization in some bodies, and not
in others. From the organization, they inferred the
life, and supposed that plants, for instance, had life,
but that minerals had none. This sort of argument
was long deemed satisfactory; but, in the course of
time, it broke down; more evidence was required, and,
since the middle of the seventeenth century, it has been
universally admitted, that the eye, by itself, is an untrustworthy
witness, and that we must employ the
microscope, instead of relying on the unaided testimony
of our own puny and precarious senses. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
microscope is steadily improving, and we cannot tell
what limits there are to its capacity for improvement.
Consequently, we cannot tell what fresh secrets it may
disclose. Neither can we say, that it may not be
altogether superseded by some new artificial resource,
which shall furnish us with evidence, as superior to any
yet supplied, as our present evidence is superior to that
of the naked eye. Even already, and notwithstanding
the shortness of time during which the microscope has
been a really effective instrument, it has revealed to us
organizations, the existence of which no one had previously
suspected. It has proved, that what, for thousands
of years, had been deemed mere specks of inert
matter, are, in truth, animals possessing most of the
functions which we possess, reproducing their species
in regular and orderly succession, and endowed with
a nervous system, which shows that they must be susceptible
of pain and enjoyment. It has detected life
hidden in the glaciers of Switzerland; it has found it
embedded in the polar ice, and, if it can flourish there,
it is hard to say from what quarter it can be shut out.
So unwilling, however, are most men to relinquish old
notions, that the resources of chemistry have been
called in, to ascertain the supposed difference between
organic and inorganic matter: it being asserted, that,
in the organic world, there is a greater complexity of
molecular combination, than in the inorganic.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> Chemists
further assert, that, in organic nature, there is a predominance
of carbon, and, in inorganic, a predominance of
silicon.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> But chemical analysis, like microscopic
observation, is making such rapid strides, that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
generation, I had almost said each year, is unsettling
some of the conclusions previously established; so that,
now, and for a long time hence, we must regard those
conclusions as empirical, and, indeed, as merely tentative.
Surely a permanent and universal inference
cannot be drawn from shifting and precarious facts,
which are admitted to-day, and may be overthrown
to-morrow. It would, therefore, appear that, in favour
of the opinion, that some bodies are living, and that
others are dead, we have nothing, except the circumstance,
that our researches, so far as they have yet
gone, have shown that cellular structure, growth, and
reproduction, are not the invariable properties of
matter, but are excluded from a large part of the visible
world, which, on that account, we call inanimate.
This is the whole of the argument on that side of the
question. On the other side, we have the fact, that
our sight, and the artificial instruments, by whose aid
we have arrived at this conclusion, are confessedly imperfect;
and we have the further fact, that, imperfect
as they are, they have proved, that the organic kingdom
is infinitely more extensive than the boldest dreamer
had ever imagined, while they have not been able to
enlarge the boundaries of the inorganic kingdom to any
thing like the same amount. This shows, that, so far
as our opinions are concerned, the balance is steadily
inclining in one given direction; in other words, as
our knowledge advances, a belief in the organic is encroaching
upon a belief in the inorganic.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> When we,
moreover, add, that all science is manifestly converging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
towards one simple and general theory, which shall
cover the whole range of material phenomena, and that,
at each successive step, some irregularities are explained
away, and some inequalities are reduced, it can hardly
be doubted, that such a movement tends to weaken
those old distinctions, the reality of which has been too
hastily assumed; and that, in their place, we must,
sooner or later, substitute the more comprehensive
view, that life is a property of all matter, and that
the classification of bodies into animate and inanimate,
or into organic and inorganic, is merely a provisional
arrangement, convenient, perhaps, for our
present purposes, but which, like all similar divisions,
will eventually be merged in a higher and wider
scheme.</p>

<p>Until, however, that step is taken, we must be content
to reason according to the evidence supplied by our
imperfect instruments, or by our still more imperfect
senses. We, therefore, recognize the difference between
organic and inorganic nature, not as a scientific truth,
but as a scientific artifice, by which we separate in idea,
what is inseparable in fact; hoping, in this way, to pursue
our course with the greater ease, and ultimately to
obtain results, which will make the artifice needless.
Assuming, then, this division, we may refer all investigations
of organic bodies to one of two objects. The first
object is, to ascertain the law of those bodies, in their
usual, healthy, or, as we somewhat erroneously phrase
it, normal course. The other object is, to ascertain
their law, in their unusual, unhealthy, or abnormal
course. When we attempt to do the first of these
things, we are physiologists. When we attempt to do
the second, we are pathologists.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>Physiology and pathology are thus the two fundamental
divisions of all organic science.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Each is intimately
connected with the other; and eventually, no
doubt, both will be fused into a single study, by discovering
laws which will prove that here, as elsewhere,
nothing is really abnormal, or irregular. Hitherto, however,
the physiologists have immeasurably outstripped
the pathologists in the comprehensiveness of their views,
and, therefore, in the value of their results. For, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
best physiologists distinctly recognize that the basis of
their science must include, not only the animals below
man, but also the entire vegetable kingdom, and that,
without this commanding survey of the whole realm
of organic nature, we cannot possibly understand even
human physiology, still less general physiology. The
pathologists, on the other hand, are so much in arrear,
that the diseases of the lower animals rarely form part
of their plan; while the diseases of plants are almost
entirely neglected, although it is certain that, until all
these have been studied, and some steps taken to generalize
them, every pathological conclusion will be eminently
empirical, on account of the narrowness of the
field from which it is collected.</p>

<p>The science of pathology being still so backward in
the conception as well as in the execution, that even
men of real ability believe that it can be raised from a
mere study of the human frame, it will hardly be expected
that the Scotch, notwithstanding the marvellous
boldness of their speculations, should have been able, in
the eighteenth century, to anticipate a method which
the nineteenth century has yet to employ. But they
produced two pathologists of great ability, and to whom
we owe considerable obligations. These were, Cullen
and John Hunter.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> Cullen was eminent only as a
pathologist; but Hunter, whose fine and discursive
genius took a much wider range, was great both in
physiology and in pathology. A short account of their
generalizations respecting organic science, will be a
fitting sequel to the notices I have already given of what
was done by their countrymen for inorganic science,
during the same period. It will complete our survey
of the Scotch intellect, and will enable the reader to
form some idea of the brilliant achievements of that
most remarkable people, who, contrary to the course of
affairs in all other modern nations, have shown that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
scientific discoveries do not necessarily weaken superstition,
and that it is possible for two hostile principles
to flourish side by side, without ever coming into actual
collision, or without sensibly impairing each other's
vigour.</p>

<p>In 1751, Cullen was appointed professor of medicine
in the University of Glasgow;<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> from which, however,
in 1756, he was removed to the University of Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>
where he delivered those celebrated lectures,
on which his fame now depends. During the early
part of his career, he paid great attention to inorganic
physics, and propounded some remarkable speculations,
which are supposed to have suggested the theory of
latent heat to Black, who was his pupil.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> But, to
follow out those views, would have required a number
of minute experiments, which it did not suit the habit
of his mind to make. Having, therefore, put forth his
ideas, he left them to germinate, and passed on to his
arduous attempt to generalize the laws of disease as they
are exhibited in the human frame. In the study of
disease, the phenomena being more obscure and less
amenable to experiment, there was greater latitude for
speculation; hence, he could more easily indulge in that
love of theory, which was his ruling passion, and with
an extreme devotion to which he has been reproached.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
That the reproach is not altogether unjust, must, I think,
be admitted, since we find him laying down the doctrine,
that, inasmuch as, in the treatment of disease, theory
could not be separated from practice, it was unimportant
which came first.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> This was tantamount to saying,
that a medical practitioner might allow his theories to
control his observations; for it is certain that, in an
immense majority of cases, men are so tenacious of the
opinions they imbibe, that whatever, in any pursuit,
first occupies their understanding, is likely to mould all
that comes afterwards. In ordinary minds, associations
of ideas, if firmly established, become indissoluble; and
the power of separating them, and of arranging them in
new combinations, is one of the rarest of our endowments.
An average intellect, when once possessed by
a theory, can hardly ever escape from it. Hence, in
practical matters, theory should be feared, just as, in
scientific matters, it should be cherished; because
practical pursuits are chiefly engrossed by the lower
class of minds, where associations and the force of prejudice
are extremely strong, while scientific pursuits
concern the higher class, where such prepossessions
are comparatively weak, and where close associations
are more easily severed. The most powerful intellects
are most accustomed to new arrangements of thought,
and are, therefore, most able to break up old ones. On
them, belief sits lightly, because they well know how
little evidence we have for many of even our oldest
beliefs. But the average, or, as we must say, without
meaning offence, the inferior, minds, are not disturbed
by these refinements. Theories, which they have once
heartily embraced, they can hardly ever get rid of, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
they often dignify them with the name of essential
truths, and resent every attack upon them as a personal
injury. Having inherited such theories from their
fathers, they regard them with a sort of filial piety, and
cling to them as if they were some rich acquisition,
which no one has a right to touch.</p>

<p>To this latter class, nearly all men belong, who are
more engaged in practical pursuits than in speculative
ones. Among them, are the ordinary practitioners,
whether in medicine or in any other department, extremely
few of whom are willing to break up trains of
thought to which they are inured.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Though they profess
to despise theory, they are, in reality, enslaved by it.
All that they can do, is to conceal their subjection, by
terming their theory a necessary belief. It must, therefore,
be deemed a remarkable proof of Cullen's love of
deductive reasoning, that he, sagacious and clear-sighted
as he was, should have supposed that, in so practical an
art as medicine, theory could, with impunity, precede
practice. For, it is most assuredly true, that, taking
men in the average, their minds are so constructed, that
it cannot precede it without controlling it. It is equally
true, that such control must be hurtful. Even now, and
notwithstanding the great steps which have been taken
in morbid anatomy, in animal chemistry, and in the
microscopic investigation both of the fluids and solids of
the human frame, the treatment of disease is a question
of art, far more than a question of science. What chiefly
characterizes the most eminent physicians, and gives
them their real superiority, is not so much the extent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
their theoretical knowledge,&mdash;though that, too, is often
considerable,&mdash;but it is that fine and delicate perception
which they owe, partly to experience, and partly to a
natural quickness in detecting analogies and differences
which escape ordinary observers. The process which
they follow, is one of rapid, and, in some degree, unconscious,
induction. And this is the reason why the
greatest physiologists and chemists, which the medical
profession possesses, are not, as a matter of course, the
best curers of disease. If medicine were a science, they
would always be the best. But medicine, being still
essentially an art, depends mainly upon qualities which
each practitioner has to acquire for himself, and which
no scientific theory can teach. The time for a general
theory has not yet come, and probably many generations
will have to elapse before it does come. To suppose,
therefore, that a theory of disease should, as a matter of
education, precede the treatment of disease, is not only
practically dangerous, but logically false. With its
practical danger I am not now concerned; but its
logical aspect is a curious illustration of that passion
for systematic and dialectic reasoning which characterized
Scotland. It shows that Cullen, in his eagerness
to argue from principles to facts, instead of from facts
to principles, could, in the most important of all arts,
recommend a method of procedure, for which even our
knowledge is not ripe, but which, in his time, was so
singularly rash and immature, that nothing can explain
its adoption by a man of such vigorous understanding,
except the circumstance of his living in a country in
which that peculiar method reigned supreme.</p>

<p>It must, however, be admitted that Cullen wielded
the method with great ability, especially in his application
of it to the science of pathology, to which it was
far better suited than to the art of therapeutics. For,
we must always remember, that the science which investigates
the laws of disease, is quite a different thing
from the art which cures it. The science has a speculative
interest, which is irrespective of all practical
considerations, and which depends simply on the fact,
that, when it is completed, it will explain the aberrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
of the whole organic world. Pathology aims at ascertaining
the causes which determine every departure
from the natural type, whether of form or of function.
Hence it is, that no one can take a comprehensive view
of the actual state of knowledge, without studying the
theoretic relations between pathology and other departments
of inquiry. To do this, is the business, not of
practical men, but of philosophers, properly so called.
The philosophic pathologist is as different from the
physician, as a jurist is different from an advocate, or as
an agricultural chemist is different from a farmer, or as
a political economist is different from a statesman, or as
an astronomer, who generalizes the laws of the heavenly
bodies, is different from a captain, who navigates his
ship by a practical application of those laws. The two
sets of functions may be united, and occasionally, though
very rarely, they are, but there is no necessity for their
being so. While, therefore, it would be absurdly presumptuous
for an unprofessional person to pass judgment
on the therapeutical system of Cullen, it is perfectly
legitimate for any one, who has studied the theory
of these matters, to examine his pathological system;
because that, like all scientific systems, must be amenable
to general considerations, which are to be taken,
partly from the adjoining sciences, and partly from the
universal logic of philosophic method.</p>

<p>It is from this latter, or logical, point of view, that
Cullen's pathology is interesting for the purposes of the
present chapter. The character of his investigations
may be illustrated by saying, that his method in pathology
is analogous to that which Adam Smith adopted at
the same time, though in a very different field. Both
were deductive; and both, before arguing deductively,
suppressed some of the premisses from which they
reasoned. That this suppression is the key to Adam
Smith's method, and was an intentional part of his plan,
I have already shown; as also that, in each of his two
works, he supplied the premisses in which the other
work was deficient. In this respect, he was far superior
to Cullen. For, though Cullen, like Smith, began by
mutilating his problem in order to solve it more readily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
he, unlike Smith, did not see the necessity of instituting
another and parallel inquiry, which should complete
the scheme, by starting from the premisses that had
been previously omitted.</p>

<p>What I have termed the mutilation of the problem,
was effected by Cullen in the following manner. His
object was, to generalize the phenomena of disease, as
they are exhibited in the human frame; and it was obvious
to him, as to every one else, that the human frame
consists partly of solids and partly of fluids. The peculiarity
of his pathology is, that he reasons almost entirely
from the laws of the solids, and makes so little account
of the fluids, that he will only allow them to be the
indirect causes of disease, which, in a scientific view, are
to be deemed strictly subordinate to the direct causes,
as represented by the solid constituents of our body.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>
This assumption, though false, was perfectly justifiable,
since, by curtailing the problem, he simplified its study;
just as Adam Smith, in his <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, simplified
the study of human nature, by curtailing it of all its
sympathy. But this most comprehensive thinker was
careful, in his <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>, to restore to
human nature the quality of which the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>
had deprived it; and, by thus establishing two different
lines of argument, he embraced the whole subject. In
the same way, it was incumbent on Cullen, after having
constructed a theory of disease by reasoning from the
solids, to have constructed another theory by reasoning
from the fluids; so that a coördination of the two theories
might have raised a science of pathology, as complete as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
the then state of knowledge allowed.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> But to this, his
mind was unequal. Able though he was, he lacked the
grasp of intellect which characterized Adam Smith, and
which made that great man perceive, that every deductive
argument which is founded on a suppression of
premisses, must be compensated by a parallel argument,
which takes those premisses into account.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> So little
was Cullen aware of this, that, having built up that
system of pathology which is known to medical writers
as Solidism, he never took the pains to accompany it
by another system, which gave the first rank to the
fluids. On the contrary, he believed that his plan was
complete and exhaustive, and that what is termed
Humoral Pathology was a fiction, which had too long
usurped the place of truth.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>Several of the views advocated by Cullen were taken
from Hoffmann, and several of the facts from Gaubius;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
but that his pathology, considered as a whole, is essentially
original, is evident from a certain unity of design
which is inconsistent with extensive plagiarism, and
which proves that he had thoroughly thought out his subject
for himself. Without, however, stopping to inquire
how much he borrowed from others, I will briefly indicate
a few of the salient points of his system, in order to
enable the reader to understand its general character.</p>

<p>According to Cullen, all the solids in the human body
are either simple or vital. The simple solids retain,
after death, the properties which they possessed during
life. But the vital solids, which form the fundamental
part of the nervous system, are marked by properties,
which disappear directly death occurs.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> Hence, the
simple solids, having fewer functions than the vital,
have also fewer diseases; and the maladies to which
they are liable admit of easy classification.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> The real
difficulty lies in the vital solids, because on their peculiarities
the whole nervous system depends, and nearly
all disorders are immediately due to changes in them.
Cullen, therefore, made the nervous system the basis of
his pathology; and, in speculating on its functions, he
assigned the chief place to an occult principle, which he
termed the Animal Power, or Energy, of the brain.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>
This principle acted on the vital solids. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
principle worked well, the body was healthy; when it
worked ill, the body was unhealthy. Since, then, the
state of the vital solids was the main cause of disorder,
and since the Energy of the brain was the main cause
of the state of the vital solids, it became important to
know what the influences were which acted on the
Energy, because in them we should find the beginning
of the series. Those influences were divided by Cullen
into physical and mental. The physical were, heat,
cold, and effluvia, the three most potent of the material
disturbers of the human frame.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> The mental influences,
which excited the brain to act on the solids, were comprised
under six different heads, namely, the will, the
emotions, the appetites, the propensities, and, finally,
the two great principles of habit and of imitation, on
which he, with good reason, laid considerable stress.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>
In arguing from these mental causes, and in generalizing
the relations between them and the sensations of the
body, he, faithful to his favourite method, proceeded
deductively from the metaphysical principles then in
vogue, without inquiring inductively into their validity,
such an induction being, he thought, no part of his
duty.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> He was too anxious to get on with his dialectic,
to be interrupted by so trifling a matter as the truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
or falsehood of the premisses on which the reason
rested. What he did in the metaphysical part of his
pathology, he also did in its physical part. Although
the blood and the nerves are the two leading features
of the human economy, he did not search into them by
a separate induction; he subjected them neither to
chemical experiments in order to learn their composition,
nor to microscopic observations in order to learn their
structure.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> This is the more observable, because
though we must admit that animal chemistry was then
generally neglected, and that its real meaning was
scarcely understood until the wonderful labours of
Berzelius revealed its importance, still the microscope
was ready to Cullen's hands; it having been invented
a hundred and fifty years before he completed his pathology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
and having been in common scientific use for about
a hundred years. But his love of synthesis overcame
him. His system is constructed by reasoning from
general principles; and of that process, he certainly
was a consummate master. Between the premisses and
the conclusion, he hardly ever lets error creep in. And,
in reference to the results of his speculations, he had one
immense merit, which will always secure to him a conspicuous
place in the history of pathology. By insisting
on the importance of the solids, he, one-sided though he
was, corrected the equal one-sidedness of his predecessors;
for, with extremely few exceptions, all the best
pathologists, from Galen downwards, had erred in ascribing
too much to the fluids, and had upheld a purely
humoral pathology. Cullen turned the minds of men in
the other direction; and though, in teaching them that
the nervous system is the sole primary seat of disease,
he committed a great mistake, it was a mistake of the
most salutary kind. By leaning on that side, he restored
the balance. Hence, I have no doubt, he indirectly encouraged
those minute researches into the nerves, which
he would not himself stop to make, but which, in the
next generation, gave rise to the capital discoveries of
Bell, Shaw, Mayo, and Marshall Hall. At the same
time, the old humoral pathology, which had prevailed
for many centuries, was practically pernicious, because,
assuming that all diseases are in the blood, it produced
that constant and indiscriminate venesection, which destroyed
innumerable lives, besides the irreparable injury
it often inflicted both on body and mind; weakening those
whom it was unable to slay. Against this merciless onslaught,
which made medicine the curse of mankind, the
Solid Pathology was the first effective barrier.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> Practically,
therefore, as well as speculatively, we must hail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
Cullen as a great benefactor of his species; and we must
regard his appearance as an epoch in the history of human
comfort, as well as in the history of human thought.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, facilitate the conceptions of unprofessional
readers, if I give, in as few words as possible,
a specimen of the way in which Cullen employed his
method, in investigating the theory of some one class of
diseases. For this purpose, I will select his doctrine of
fever, which, though now generally abandoned, once
exercised more influence than any other part of his
pathology. Here, as elsewhere, he reasons from the
solids.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Disregarding the state of the blood, he says,
that the cause of all fever is a diminished energy of
the brain.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> Such diminution may be produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
various sedatives, the most common of which are
effluvia, whether marsh or human, intemperance, fear,
and cold.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> Directly the energy of the brain is impaired,
the disease begins. Rapidly passing through
the nervous system, its first palpable effect is a chill, or
cold fit, which is accompanied by a spasm on the extremities
of the arteries, particularly where they touch
the surface of the body.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> This spasm on the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
vessels, irritates the heart and arteries, and the irritation
continues till the spasm is relaxed.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> At the same
time, the increased action of the heart restores the
energy of the brain; the system rallies; the extreme
vessels are relieved; while, as a consequence of the
whole movement, sweat is excreted, and the fever
abates.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> Shutting out, therefore, all consideration of
the fluids of the body, the successive stages of languor,
cold fit, and hot fit, might, in Cullen's opinion, be
generalized by reasoning merely from the solids, which,
furthermore, produced his well-known distinction between
fevers, the continuance of which is owing to an
excess of spasm, and those, the continuance of which is
owing to an excess of debility.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>A similar process of thought gave birth to his
<i>Nosology</i>, or general classification of diseases, which
some have regarded as the most valuable part of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
labours;<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> though, for reasons already mentioned, we
must, I think, reject all such attempts as premature, and
as likely to work more harm than good, unless they are
simply used as a contrivance to aid the memory. At
all events, the <i>Nosology</i> of Cullen, though it exhibits
clear traces of his powerful and organizing mind, is
fast falling into disrepute, and we may be sure, that,
for a long time yet, a similar fate will await its successors.
Our pathological knowledge is still too young
for so great an enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> We have every reason to
expect, that, with the aid of chemistry, and of the
microscope, it will continue to grow more rapidly than
it has hitherto done. Without venturing to predict the
rate of its increase, we may form some idea of it, by
considering what has been effected with resources very
inferior to those we now possess. In a work of great
authority, published in the year 1848, it is stated, that
since the appearance of Cullen's <i>Nosology</i>, our mere
enumeration of diseases has almost doubled, while our
knowledge of the facts relating to disease has more
than doubled.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p>I have now only one more name to add to this splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
catalogue of the great Scotchmen of the eighteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> But it is the name of a man, who, for comprehensive
and original genius, comes immediately after
Adam Smith, and must be placed far above any other
philosopher whom Scotland has produced. I mean, of
course, John Hunter, whose only fault was, an occasional
obscurity, not merely of language, but also of
thought. In this respect, and, perhaps, in this alone,
Adam Smith had the advantage; for his mind was so
flexible, and moved so freely, that even the vastest
designs were unable to oppress it. With Hunter, on
the contrary, it sometimes seemed as if the understanding
was troubled by the grandeur of his own conceptions,
and doubted what path it ought to take. He
hesitated; the utterance of his intellect was indistinct.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>
Still, his powers were so extraordinary, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
among the great masters of organic science, he belongs,
I apprehend, to the same rank as Aristotle, Harvey, and
Bichat, and is somewhat superior either to Haller or
Cuvier. As to this classification, men will differ, according
to their different ideas of the nature of science,
and, above all, according to the extent to which they
appreciate the importance of philosophic method. It is
from this latter point of view that I have, at present, to
consider the character of John Hunter; and, in tracing
the movements of his most remarkable mind, we shall
find, that, in it, deduction and induction were more
intimately united than in any other Scotch intellect,
either of the seventeenth or eighteenth century. The
causes of this unusual combination, I will now endeavour
to ascertain. When they are understood, they
will not only explain many peculiarities in his works,
but will afford materials for speculation, to those who
love to examine the development of ideas, and who are
able to discern the way in which different schemes of
national thought have given different shapes to national
character, and have thereby modified the whole course
of human affairs, to an extent of which the ordinary
compilers of history have not the slightest suspicion.</p>

<p>Hunter remained in Scotland till the age of twenty,
when he settled in London; and, though he was abroad
for about three years, he abandoned his own country,
and became, socially and intellectually, a native of
England.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> Hence, the early associations of his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
were formed in the midst of a deductive nation; the
later associations, in the midst of an inductive one.
For twenty years he lived among a people, who are,
perhaps, the acutest reasoners in Europe, if you concede
to them the principles from which they reason; but
who, on the other hand, owing to their proneness to
this method, are so greedy after general principles, that
they will accept them on almost any evidence, and are,
therefore, at once very credulous and very logical. In
that school, and surrounded by those habits, the intellect
of John Hunter was nurtured during the most
impressible period of his life. Then the scene suddenly
shifted. Coming to England, he passed forty years in
the heart of the most empirical nation in Europe; a
nation utterly abhorring all general principles, priding
itself on its common sense, boasting, and with good
reason too, of its practical sagacity, proclaiming aloud
the superiority of facts over ideas, and despising every
theory, unless some direct and immediate benefit could
be expected to accrue from it. The young and ardent
Scotchman found himself transplanted into a country
totally different from that which he had just quitted;
and such a difference could not fail to influence his
mind. He saw, on every side, marks of prosperity, and
of long and uninterrupted success, not only in practical,
but also in speculative, life; and he was told that these
things were effected by a system which made facts the
first consideration. He was ambitious of fame, but he
perceived that the road to fame was not the same in
England as in Scotland. In Scotland, a great logician
would be deemed a great man; in England, little account
would be made of the beauty of his logic, unless he was
careful that the premisses from which he argued,
were trustworthy, and verified by experience. A new
machine, a new experiment, the discovery of a salt, or
of a bone, would, in England, receive a wider homage,
than the most profound speculation from which no
obvious results were apprehended. That this way of
contemplating affairs has produced great good, is certain.
But it is also certain, that it is a one-sided way,
and satisfies only part of the human mind. Many of
the noblest intellects crave for something which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
cannot supply. In England, however, during the greater
part of the eighteenth century, it was even more
supreme than it is now, and was, indeed, so universal,
that, from the year 1727 until nearly the close of the
century, our country did not possess, in any branch of
science, a speculator who had sufficient force to raise
himself above those narrow views which were then
deemed the perfection of wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> Much was added
to our knowledge, but its distant boundaries were not
enlarged. Though there was an increase of curious
and valuable details, and though several of the small
and proximate laws of nature were generalized, it must
be admitted, that those lofty generalizations, which we
owe to the seventeenth century, remained stationary,
and that no attempt was made to push beyond them.
When John Hunter arrived in London, in 1748, Newton
had been dead more than twenty years, and the English
people, absorbed in practical pursuits, and now beginning,
for the first time, to enter into political life, had
become more averse than ever to inquiries which aimed
at truth without regard to utility, and had accustomed
themselves to value science chiefly for the sake of the
direct and tangible benefit which they might hope to
derive from it.</p>

<p>That Hunter must have been influenced by these
circumstances, will be obvious to whoever considers
how impossible it is for any single mind to escape from
the pressure of contemporary opinion. But, inasmuch
as all his early associations had inclined him in another
direction, we perceive that, during his long residence
in England, he was acted on by two conflicting forces.
The country of his birth made him deductive; the
country of his adoption made him inductive. As a
Scotchman, he preferred reasoning from general principles
to particular facts; as an inhabitant of England,
he became inured to the opposite plan of reasoning
from particular facts to general principles. In every
country, men naturally give the first place to what is
most valued. The English respect facts more than
principles, and therefore begin with the facts. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
Scotch consider principles as most important, and
therefore begin with the principles. And, I make
no doubt that one of the reasons why Hunter, in
investigating a subject, is often obscure, is that, on
such occasions, his mind was divided between these
two hostile methods, and that, leaning sometimes to
one and sometimes to the other, he was unable to determine
which he should choose. The conflict darkened
his understanding. Adam Smith, on the other hand,
in common with all the great Scotchmen who remained
in Scotland, was remarkably clear. He, like Hume,
Black, and Cullen, never wavered in his method.
These eminent men were not acted on by English
influence. Of all the most illustrious Scotchmen of the
eighteenth century, Hunter alone underwent that influence,
and he alone displayed a certain hesitation and
perplexity of thought, which seems unnatural to so
great a mind, and which, as it appears to me, is best
explained by the peculiar circumstances in which he
was placed.</p>

<p>One of the ablest of his commentators has justly
observed, that his natural inclination was, to conjecture
what the laws of nature were, and then reason from
them, instead of reasoning to them by slow and gradual
induction.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> This process of deduction was, as I have
shown, the favourite method of all Scotchmen, and,
therefore, was precisely the course which we should
have expected him to adopt. But, inasmuch as he
was surrounded by the followers of Bacon,<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
natural bias was warped, and a large part of his marvellous
activity was employed in observations and
experiments, such as no Scotch thinker, living in Scotland,
would ever have engaged in. He himself declared,
that thinking was his delight;<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> and there can
be no doubt that, had he been differently situated,
thinking would have been his principal pursuit. As it
was, the industry with which he collected facts, is one
of the most conspicuous features in his career. His
researches covered the whole range of the animal kingdom,
and were conducted with such untiring zeal, that
he dissected upwards of five hundred different species,
exclusive of dissections of different individuals, and
exclusive, too, of dissections of a large number of
plants.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> The results were carefully arranged and
stored up in that noble collection which he formed,
and of the magnitude of which we may gain some idea
from the statement, that, at his death, it contained
upwards of ten thousand preparations illustrative of
the phenomena of nature.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> By this means, he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
so intimately acquainted with the animal kingdom,
that he made a vast number of discoveries, which, considered
singly, are curious, but which, when put
together, constitute an invaluable body of new truths.
Of these, the most important are, the true nature of
the circulation in crustacea and insects;<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> the organ

canals of the cetacea;<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> the lymphatics of
birds;<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> and the air-cells in the bones of birds.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>
We are also assured, that he anticipated the recent discoveries
respecting the embryo of the kangaroo;<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>
and his published works prove, that, in the human
subject, he discovered the muscularity of the arteries,<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
the muscularity of the iris,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> and the digestion of the
stomach after death by its own juice.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> Although, in
his time, animal chemistry was not yet raised to a
system, and was consequently little heeded by physiologists,
Hunter endeavoured, by its aid, to search out
the qualities of the blood, so as to ascertain the properties
of its constituents.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> He also examined it in
different stages of embryonic life, and by minutely
tracking it through its periods of development, he made
the capital discovery, that the red globules of the blood
are formed later than its other components. His contemporaries,
however, were so little alive to the importance
of this great physiological truth, that it fell dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
upon them, and, being forgotten, it was, about fifty
years afterwards, rediscovered, and was announced, in
1832, as a law of nature which had just been brought
to light.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> This is one of many instances in the
history of our knowledge, which proves how useless it
is for a man to advance too far beyond the age in
which he lives.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> But Hunter, besides making the
discovery, also saw its meaning. From it, he inferred
that the function of the red globules is to minister to
the strength of the system, rather than to its repair.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>
This is now universally admitted; but it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
admitted till long after his death. Its recognition is
chiefly owing to the rapid advance of animal chemistry,
and to improvements in the microscope. For, by the
employment of these resources, it has become manifest,
that the red globules, the respiratory process, the production
of animal heat, and the energy of the locomotive
organs, are but different parts of a single
scheme.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> Their connexion with each other is established,
not only by a comparison of different species,
but also by a comparison of different members of
the same species. In human beings, for example,
the locomotive and other animal functions are more
active in persons of a sanguine temperament than
in those of a lymphatic temperament; while, in sanguine
temperaments, the globules are more numerous
than in lymphatic ones. The knowledge of this
fact we owe to Lecanu;<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> and to him we are also
indebted for an analogous fact, corroborating the same
view. He has shown, that the blood of women contains
more water and fewer red globules than the
blood of men;<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> so that here again we discern the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
relation between these globules and the energy of
animal life. Inasmuch, however, as these researches
were not made until many years after the death of
Hunter, the coincidence between them and his speculative
conclusions is a striking instance of his power
of generalization, and of that unrivalled knowledge of
comparative anatomy, which supplied him with materials
from which, in spite of the backwardness of
animal chemistry, he was able to draw an inference,
which later and minuter researches have decisively
verified.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>Having thus, by a comprehensive survey of the
animal world, associated its remarkable faculty of
movement with the state of its blood, Hunter turned
his attention to another aspect of the question, and took
into consideration the movements of the vegetable
world, in the hope that, by comparing these two divisions
of nature, he might detect some law, which, being
common to both, should unite into one study all the
principles of organic motion. Though he failed in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
great undertaking, some of his generalizations are very
suggestive, and well illustrate the power and grasp of
his mind. Looking at the organic kingdom as a whole,
he supposed that its capacity of action, both in animals
and in vegetables, was of three kinds. The first kind,
was the action of the individual upon the materials it
already possessed; and this gave rise to growth, secretion,
and other functions, in which the juice of the
plant was equivalent to the blood of the animal.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>
The second kind of action had for its object to increase
these materials; it was always excited by want, and
its result was, to nourish and preserve the individual.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>
The third kind was entirely due to external causes,
including the whole material world, all the phenomena
of which were a stimulus to some kind of action.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
By combining, in different ways, these different sources of
motion, and by studying every incitement to action, first,
in reference to one of the three great divisions just indicated,
and, secondly, in reference to the <i>power</i> of action,
as distinguished from the <i>quantity</i> of action,<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> Hunter
believed that some fundamental truths might be obtained,
if not by himself, at all events by his successors.
For, he thought that, though animals can do many
things which plants cannot, still, the immediate cause
of action is in both cases the same.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> In animals, there
is more variety of motion, but in plants there is more
real power. A horse is certainly far stronger than a
man. Yet a small vine cannot only support, but can
raise, a column of fluid five times higher than a horse
can. Indeed, the power which a plant exercises of
holding a leaf erect during an entire day, without pause
and without fatigue, is an effort of astonishing vigour,
and is one of many proofs, that a principle of compensation
is at work, so that the same energy which, in
the animal world, is weakened by being directed to
many objects, is, in the vegetable world, strengthened
by being concentrated on a few.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>In pursuing these speculations, which, amid much
that is uncertain, contain, I firmly believe, a large
amount of important, though neglected, truth, Hunter
was led to consider how motion is produced by various
forces, such as magnetism, electricity, gravitation, and
chemical attraction.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> This carried him into inorganic
science, where, as he clearly saw, the foundation of all
organic science must be laid. Just as, on the one hand,
the human frame could never be successfully studied,
except by the aid of principles which had been collected
from an investigation of animals below man,<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> so, on
the other hand, the laws of those very animals must,
he said, be approached through the laws of common or
inorganic matter.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> He, therefore, aimed at nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
less than to unite all the branches of physical science,
taking them in the order of their relative complexity,
and proceeding from the simplest to the most intricate.
With this view, he examined the structure of the
mineral kingdom, and, by an extensive comparison of
crystals, he sought to generalize the principles of form,
in the same way as, by a comparison of animals, he
sought to generalize the principles of function. And, in
doing this, he took into account, not only regular crystals,
but also irregular ones.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> For, he knew that, in
nature, nothing is really irregular or disorderly; though
our imperfect apprehension, or rather the backwardness
of our knowledge, prevents us from discerning the
symmetry of the universal scheme. The beauty of the
plan, and the necessity of the sequence, are not always
perceptible. Hence, we are too apt to fancy that the
chain is broken, because we cannot see every link in it.
From this serious error, Hunter was saved by his
genius, even more than by his knowledge. Being
satisfied that every thing which happens in the material
world, is so connected and bound up with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
antecedents, as to be the inevitable result of what had
previously occurred, he looked with a true philosophical
eye at the strangest and most capricious shapes, because
to him they had a meaning and a necessary purpose.
To him, they were neither strange nor capricious.
They were deviations from the natural course; but it
was a fundamental tenet of his philosophy, that nature,
even in the midst of her deviations, still retains her
regularity.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> Or, as he elsewhere expresses it, deviation
is, under certain circumstances, part of the law of
nature.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>To generalize such irregularities, or, in other words,
to show that they are not irregularities at all, was the
main object of Hunter's life, and was the noblest part of
his mission. Hence, notwithstanding his vast achievements
in physiology, his favourite pursuit was pathology,<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>
where, the phenomena being more complex, the
intellect has more play. In this great field, he studied
the aberrations of structure and of function, in the
vegetable, as well as in the animal, world;<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
for the aberrations of form, which are the external
manifestations of disturbed structure, he took into consideration
the appearances presented by the mineral
kingdom. There, the power of crystallization is the
leading feature, and there, violations of symmetry constitute
the essential disorder, whether the deformity of
the crystal is subsequent to its production, or whether,
being the result of what happened before its production,
it is an original, and, if we may so say, congenital,
defect. In either case, it is a deviation from the normal
type, and, as such, is analogous to the monstrosities,
both of animals and of vegetables.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> The mind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
Hunter, by sweeping through this immense range of
thought, attained to such commanding views of the
philosophy of disease, that, in that department, he is
certainly without a rival. As a physiologist, he was
equalled, or perhaps excelled, by Aristotle; but as a
pathologist, he stands alone, if we consider what pathology
was when he found it, and what it was when he
left it.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> Since his death, the rapid advance of morbid
anatomy and of chemistry has caused some of his doctrines
to be modified, and some of them to be overturned.
This has been the work of inferior men,
wielding superior chemical and microscopical resources.
To say that the successors of John Hunter are inferior
to him, is no disparagement to their abilities, since he
was one of those extremely rare characters who only
appear at very long intervals, and who, when they do
appear, remodel the fabric of knowledge. They revolutionize
our modes of thought; they stir up the intellect
to insurrection; they are the rebels and demagogues
of science. And though the pathologists of the nineteenth
century have chosen a humbler path, this must
not blind us to their merits, or prevent us from being
grateful for what they have done. We cannot, however,
be too often reminded, that the really great men,
and those who are the sole permanent benefactors of
their species, are not the great experimenters, nor the
great observers, nor the great readers, nor the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
scholars, but the great thinkers. Thought is the creator
and vivifier of all human affairs. Actions, facts, and
external manifestations of every kind, often triumph
for a while; but it is the progress of ideas which ultimately
determines the progress of the world. Unless
these are changed, every other change is superficial,
and every improvement is precarious. It is, however,
evident that, in the present state of our knowledge, all
ideas respecting nature must refer either to the normal
or to the abnormal; that is to say, they must be concerned
either with what is regular, uniform, and obedient
to recognized principles, or else with what is
irregular, perturbed, and disobedient. Of these two
divisions, the first belongs to science; the second, to superstition.
John Hunter formed the superb conception
of merging both classes of ideas into one, by showing
that nothing is irregular, that nothing is perturbed, that
nothing is disobedient. Centuries, perhaps, may elapse
before that conception will be consummated. But what
Hunter effected towards it, places him at the head of
all pathologists, ancient or modern. For, with him,
the science of pathology did not mean the laws of disease
in man alone, or even in all animals, or even in
the whole organic kingdom; but it meant the laws of
disease and of malformation in the entire material
world, organic and inorganic. His great object was,
to raise a science of the abnormal. He determined to
contemplate nature as a vast and united whole, exhibiting,
indeed, at different times different appearances,
but preserving, amidst every change, a principle of
uniform and uninterrupted order, admitting of no deviation,
undergoing no disturbance, and presenting no
real irregularity, albeit to the common eye, irregularities
abound on every side.</p>

<p>As pathology was the science to which Hunter was
most devoted, so also was it that in which his natural
love of deduction was most apparent. Here, far more
than in his physiological inquiries, do we find a desire
to multiply original principles from which he could
reason; in opposition to the inductive method, which
always aims at diminishing these principles by gradual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
and successive analysis. Thus, for instance, in his
animal pathology, he attempted to introduce, as an
ultimate principle from which he could argue, the idea
that all diseases move more rapidly towards the skin
than towards internal parts, by virtue of some hidden
force, which also obliges vegetables to approach the
surface of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> Another favourite proposition,
which he often used as a major premiss, and by its aid
constructed deductively a pathological argument, was,
that in no substance, be it what it may, can two processes
go on in the same part at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> By
applying this universal proposition to the more limited
phenomena of animal life, he inferred that two general
diseases cannot co-exist in the same individual; and he
relied so much on this ratiocination, that he refused to
credit any testimony by which it was impugned.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
There is reason to believe that his conclusion is erroneous,
and that different diseases can so accompany
each other, as to be united in the same individual, at
the same time, and in the same part.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> Whether or not
this be the case, it is equally interesting to notice the
process of thought which led Hunter to bestow infinitely
more pains in arguing from the general theory, than in
arguing to it. Indeed, he can hardly be said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
argued to it at all, since he obtained it by a rough and
hasty generalization from what seemed to be the obvious
properties of inorganic matter. Having thus obtained
it, he applied it to the pathological phenomena of the
organic world, and especially of the animal world.
That he should have adopted this course, is a curious
proof of the energy of his deductive habits, and of the
force of mind which enabled him so to set at naught
the traditions of his English contemporaries, as to
follow a method which, in the opinion of every one
who surrounded him, was not only full of danger, but
could never lead to truth.</p>

<p>Other parts of his pathology abound with similar
instances, which show how anxious he was to assume
principles on which he could build arguments. Of this
kind were his ideas respecting sympathy, as connected
with action. He suggested, that the simplest forms of
sympathy would probably be found in the vegetable
world, because there, the general arrangements are less
intricate than in the animal world.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> On this supposition,
he constructed a series of curious and refined
speculations, of which, however, I must confine myself
to giving a very short summary. As animals sympathize
more than vegetables, this helps us to understand
why it is that their movements are more numerous.
For, sympathy, being a susceptibility to impression, is
also a principle of action.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> Like other principles of
action, it may be either natural or diseased.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> But,
whichever it be, it can, in plants, have only one mode
of development, because, in them, it can only be influenced
by stimulus; while in animals, which have
sensation, it has necessarily three modes, one from
stimulus, one from sensation, and a third compounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
of the other two.<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> These are the largest divisions of
sympathy, if we consider the organic world as a whole.
In single cases, however, sympathy admits of still
further subdivision. We may reason from it, in reference
to the age of the individual;<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> we may also reason
from it in reference to temperament, since, in point
of fact, temperament is nothing but susceptibility to
action.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> And when sympathy is in action, we may,
by analyzing our idea of it, reduce it to five different
heads, and may classify it as continued, or contiguous,
or remote, or similar, or dissimilar.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> All these supplied
Hunter with principles from which, by reasoning
deductively, he attempted to explain the facts of
disease; for, according to him, disease merely consists
in a want of combination of actions.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> By this process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
of thought, he was induced to neglect those predisposing
causes, to which inductive pathologists pay
great attention, and with which the works of his
English contemporaries were much occupied. Such
causes could only be generalized from observation, and
Hunter made no account of them. Indeed, he even
denies their real existence, and asserts that a predisposing
cause is simply an increased susceptibility to
form disposition to action.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p>By reasoning from the twofold ideas of action and of
sympathy, Hunter constructed the deductive or synthetic
part of his pathology. This he did as a Scotchman,
and to this, had he always lived in Scotland, he would
probably have confined himself. But being for forty
years surrounded by Englishmen, and having his mind
impregnated by English habits, he contracted something
of their mode of thought. We, accordingly, find that a
considerable portion of his pathology is as inductive as
the most eager disciple of Bacon could desire; forming,
in this respect, a striking contrast to the purely synthetic
method of Cullen, the other great pathologist of
Scotland. In the attempt, however, which Hunter
made to mix these two methods, he perplexed both
himself and his readers. Hence that obscurity, which
even his warmest admirers have noticed, though they
have not perceived its cause. Vast as his powers were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
he was unable to effect a complete union between
induction and deduction. That this should have happened,
will not surprise any one, who considers how
some of the greatest thinkers have failed in this, the
most difficult of all enterprises. Among the ancients,
Plato failed in induction, and all his followers failed
with him; since none of them have placed sufficient
confidence in facts, and in the process of reasoning
from particulars to generals. Among the moderns,
Bacon was deficient in deduction, and every Baconian
has been similarly deficient; it being the essential vice
of that school to despise reasoning from general propositions,
and to underrate the value of the syllogism.
It may, indeed, be doubted if the history of the world
supplies more than two instances of physical philosophers
being as great in one form of investigation as in
the other. They are Aristotle and Newton, who wielded
each method with equal ease, combining the skill and
boldness of deduction with the caution and perseverance
of induction, masters alike of synthesis and of analysis,
as capable of proceeding from generals to particulars,
as from particulars to generals, sometimes making
ideas precede facts, and sometimes making facts precede
ideas, but never faltering, never doubting which
course to take, and never allowing either scheme unduly
to encroach on its opposite. That Hunter should
be unable to perform this, merely proves that he was
inferior to these two men, whose almost incredible
achievements entitle them to be termed the prodigies of
the human race. But what he did was wonderful, and,
in his own department, has never been rivalled. Of the
character and extent of his inquiries, I have given a
sketch, which, notwithstanding its imperfections, may
serve to illustrate the antagonism of the Scotch and
English intellects, by showing how the methods peculiar
to each nation struggled for mastery in that great
mind, which was exposed to the action of both. Which
method predominated in Hunter, it would be hard to
say. But it is certain, that his understanding was
troubled by their conflict. It is also certain, that,
owing to his love of deduction, or of reasoning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
general ideas, he exercised much less sway over his
English contemporaries, than he would have done if he
had exclusively followed their favourite method of
reasoning from particular facts. Hence, the disproportion
between his influence and his merits. As to
his merits, it is now admitted that, in addition to his
physiological discoveries, and the great pathological
views which he propounded, we may trace to him
nearly all the surgical improvements which were introduced
within about forty years after his death.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
He was the first who explained, and, indeed, the first
who recognized, the disease of inflammation of the
veins, which is of frequent occurrence, and, under the
name of phlebitis, has latterly been much studied, but
which, before his time, had been ascribed to the most
erroneous causes.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> On general inflammation, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
threw so much light, that the doctrines which he
advocated, and which were then ridiculed as whimsical
novelties, are now taught in the schools, and have
become part of the common traditions of the medical
profession.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> He, moreover, introduced what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
probably the most capital improvement in surgery ever
effected by a single man; namely, the practice in
aneurism of tying the artery at a distance from the seat
of disease. This one suggestion has saved thousands of
lives; and both the suggestion, and the first successful
execution of it, are entirely owing to John Hunter, who,
if he had done nothing else, would, on this account
alone, have a right to be classed among the principal
benefactors of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>But, so far as his own immediate reputation was
concerned, all was in vain. He was in the midst of
a people who had no sympathy with that mode of
thought which was most natural to him. They cared
nothing for ideas, except with a few to direct and
tangible results; he valued ideas for themselves, and
for the sake of their truth, independently of all other
considerations. His English contemporaries, prudent,
sagacious, but short-sighted, seeing few things at a
time, but seeing those things with admirable clearness,
were unable to appreciate his comprehensive
speculations. Hence, in their opinion, he was little
else than an innovator and an enthusiast.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> Hence,
too, even the practical improvements which he introduced
were coldly received, because they proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
from so suspicious a source. The great Scotchman,
thrown among a nation whose habits of mind were
uncongenial to his own, stood, says one of the most
celebrated of his disciples, in a position of solitary and
comfortless superiority.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Indeed, so little was he
regarded by that very profession of which he was the
chiefest ornament, that, during the many years in
which he delivered lectures in London on anatomy and
on surgery, his audience never amounted to twenty
persons.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<hr class="hr65" />

<p>I have now completed my examination of the Scotch
intellect as it unfolded itself in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. The difference between those
two periods must strike every reader. In the seventeenth
century, the ablest Scotchmen wasted their
energies on theological subjects, respecting which we
have no trustworthy information, and no means of
obtaining any. On these topics, different persons and
different nations, equally honest, equally enlightened,
and equally competent, have entertained, and still entertain,
the most different opinions, which they advocate
with the greatest confidence, and support by
arguments, perfectly satisfactory to themselves, but
contemptuously rejected by their opponents. Each
side deeming itself in possession of the truth, the impartial
inquirer, that is, he who really loves truth, and
knows how difficult it is to obtain it, seeks for some
means by which he may fairly adjudicate between
these conflicting pretensions, and determine which is
right and which is wrong. The further he searches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
the more he becomes convinced that no such means
are to be found, and that these questions, if they do
not transcend the limits of the human understanding,
do, certainly, transcend its present resources, and have
no chance of being answered, while other and much
simpler problems are still unsolved. It would be
strange, indeed, if we, ignorant of so many lower and
subordinate matters, should be able to reach and penetrate
these remote and complicated mysteries. It
would be strange if we, who, notwithstanding the
advances we have made, are still in the infancy of our
career, and who, like infants, can only walk with unsteady
gait, and are scarce able to move without
stumbling, even on plain and level ground, should,
nathless, succeed in scaling those dizzy heights, which,
overhanging our path, lure us on where we are sure to
fall. Unfortunately, however, men are, in every age,
so little conscious of their deficiencies, that they not
only attempt this impossible task, but believe they have
achieved it. Of those who are a prey to this delusion,
there are always a certain number, who, seated on
their imaginary eminence, are so inflated by the fancied
superiority, as to undertake to instruct, to warn, and
to rebuke the rest of mankind. Giving themselves out
as spiritual advisers, and professing to teach what they
have not yet learned, they exhibit in their own persons
that most consistent of all combinations, a combination
of great ignorance with great arrogance. From this,
other evils inevitably follow. The ignorance produces
superstition; the arrogance produces tyranny. Hence
it is, that, in a country like Scotland, where the pressure
of long-continued and adverse circumstances has
consolidated the power of these pretenders to wisdom,
such sad results become conspicuous in every direction.
Not only the national character, but also the national
literature, feel their influence, and are coloured by
them. It was, therefore, natural that, in Scotland, in
the seventeenth century, when the authority of the
clergy was most uncontrolled, the consequences of that
authority should be most apparent. It was natural
that a literature should be created such as that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
which I have given some account; a literature which
encouraged superstition, intolerance, and bigotry; a
literature full of dark misgivings, and of still darker
threats; a literature which taught men that it was
wrong to enjoy the present, and that it was right to
tremble at the future; a literature, in a word, which,
spreading gloom on every side, soured the temper,
corrupted the affections, numbed the intellect, and
brought into complete discredit those bold and original
inquiries, without which there can be no advance in
human knowledge, and consequently no increase of
human happiness.</p>

<p>To this, the literature of the eighteenth century offered
a striking and most exhilarating contrast. It seemed
as if, in a moment, all was changed. The Baillies, the
Binnings, the Dicksons, the Durhams, the Flemings,
the Frasers, the Gillespies, the Guthries, the Halyburtons,
the Hendersons, the Rutherfords, and the rest of
that monkish rabble, were succeeded by eminent and
enterprising thinkers, whose genius lighted up every
department of knowledge, and whose minds, fresh and
vigorous as the morning, opened for themselves a new
career, and secured for their country a high place in
the annals of European intellect. Something of what
they effected, I have endeavoured to narrate; much,
however, has been left untold. But I have brought
forward sufficient evidence to convince even the most
sceptical reader of the splendour of their achievements,
and of the difference between the noble literature
which they produced, and those wretched compositions
which disfigured the preceding century.</p>

<p>Still, great as the difference was, the two literatures
had, as I have shown, one important point in common.
Both were essentially deductive; and the proof of
this I have given at considerable length, because,
though it has, so far as I am aware, escaped the attention
of all previous inquirers, its consequences were
of the utmost moment to the fortunes of Scotland,
and are, moreover, full of interest to those who, in
their investigations of human affairs, desire to penetrate
below the mere surface and symptoms of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>If we take a general view of those countries where
science has been cultivated, we shall find that,
wherever the deductive method of inquiry has predominated,
knowledge, though often increased and
accumulated, has never been widely diffused. On the
other hand, we shall find that, when the inductive
method has predominated, the diffusion of knowledge
has always been considerable, or, at all events, has been
beyond comparison greater than when deduction was
prevalent. This holds good, not only of different
countries, but also of different periods in the same
country. It even holds good of different individuals
in the same period, and in the same country. If, in
any civilized nation, two men, equally gifted, were to
propound some new and startling conclusion, and one
of these men were to defend his conclusion by reasoning
from ideas or general principles, while the other man
were to defend his by reasoning from particular and
visible facts, there can be no doubt that, supposing all
other things the same, the latter man would gain most
adherents. His conclusion would be more easily diffused,
simply because a direct appeal, in the first
instance, to palpable facts, strikes the vulgar with
immediate effect; while an appeal to principles is
beyond their ken, and as they do not sympathize with
it, they are apt to ridicule it. Facts seem to come
home to every one, and are undeniable. Principles are
not so obvious, and, being often disputed, they have, to
those who do not grasp them, an unreal and illusory
appearance, which weakens their influence. Hence it
is that inductive science, which always gives the first
place to facts, is essentially popular, and has on its
side those innumerable persons, who will not listen to
the more refined and subtle teachings of deductive
science. Hence, too, we find historically that the
establishment of the modern inductive philosophy, with
its varied and attractive experiments, its material appliances,
and its constant appeal to the senses, has been
intimately connected with the awakening of the public
mind, and coincides with that spirit of inquiry, and
with that love of liberty, which have been constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
advancing since the sixteenth century. We may assuredly
say, that scepticism and democracy are the two
leading features of this great scientific movement. The
seventeenth century, which ushered in the Baconian
philosophy, was remarkable for its insubordinate spirit,
especially in the country where that philosophy originated,
and where it most flourished. In the next age,
it was transplanted into France, and there, too, it
worked upon the popular mind, and, was, as I have
already pointed out, one of the principal causes of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>If we look still closer into this interesting question,
we shall find further corroboration of the view, that the
inferences of an inductive philosophy are more likely to
be diffused than those of a deductive one. Inductive
science rests immediately upon experience, or, at all
events, upon experiment, which is merely experience
artificially modified. Now, an immense majority of
mankind, even in the most advanced countries, are, by
the constitution of their minds, incapable of seizing
general principles and applying them to daily affairs,
without doing serious mischief, either to themselves, or
to others. Such an application requires not only great
dexterity, but also a knowledge of those disturbing
causes which affect the operation of all general theorems.
The task, being so difficult to perform, is rarely attempted;
and average men, possessed of a tolerably
sound judgment, do, with good reason, rely mainly on
experience, which is to them a safer and more useful
guide than any principle, however accurate and scientific
it might be. This begets in their minds a prejudice
on behalf of experimental inquiries, and a corresponding
dislike of the opposite and more speculative method.
And it can, I think, hardly be doubted, that one of the
causes of the triumph of the Baconian philosophy, is the
growth of the industrious classes, whose business-like
and methodical habits are eminently favourable to empirical
observations of the uniformities of sequence,
since, indeed, on the accuracy of such observations the
success of all practical affairs depends. Certainly, we
find that the overthrow of the purely deductive scholasticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
of the Middle Ages has been everywhere accompanied
by the spread of trade; and whoever will carefully
study the history of Europe, will discern many
traces of a connexion between the two movements, both
of which are marked by an increasing respect for material
and empirical interests, and a disregard of ideal and
speculative pursuits.</p>

<p>The relation between all this and the popular tendency
of induction is obvious. For one person who can
think, there are at least a hundred persons who can
observe. An accurate observer is, no doubt, rare; but
an accurate thinker is far rarer. Of this the proofs are
too abundant to be disputed. Indeed, no one can mix
with his fellow-creatures, without seeing how much
more natural it is for them to notice than to reflect;
and how extremely unusual it is to meet with any one
whose conversation, or whose writings, bear marks of
patient and original thought. And, inasmuch as thinkers
are more prone to accumulate ideas, while observers are
more prone to accumulate facts, the overwhelming predominance
of the observing class is a decisive reason
why induction, which begins with facts, is always more
popular than deduction, which begins with ideas. It is
often said, and probably with truth, that all deduction
is preceded by induction; so that, in every syllogism,
the major premiss, however obvious and necessary it
may appear, is merely a generalization of facts, or
record of what the senses had already observed. But
this opinion, whether true or false, does not affect what
I have just stated, because it concerns the origin of our
knowledge, and not its subsequent treatment; that is
to say, it is a metaphysical opinion, rather than a logical
one. For, even supposing that all deduction rests ultimately
on induction, it is, nevertheless, certain that
there are innumerable cases in which the induction
takes place at so early a period of life that we are
unconscious of it, and can by no effort recall the process.
The axioms of geometry afford a good specimen
of this. No one can tell when or how he first believed
that the whole is greater than its part, or that things
which are equal to the same thing are equal to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
another. All these preliminary steps are concealed
from us, and the strength and dexterity of deduction
are displayed in the subsequent steps by which the
major premiss is adjusted, and, as it were, fitted to the
minor. This often requires great subtlety of thought,
and, in every instance, the external world is put aside,
and lost sight of. The process, being ideal, has no
concern, either with observations or experiments. The
suggestions of the senses are shut out, while the mind
passes through a long train of successive syllogisms, in
which each conclusion is turned into the premiss of a
new argument, until, at length, an inference is deductively
obtained, which, to those who merely hear it
enunciated, seems to have no connexion with the first
premisses, though, in reality, it is the necessary consequence
of them.</p>

<p>A method, so recondite, and so hidden from the public
gaze, can never command the public sympathy. Unless,
therefore, the human mind should undergo some remarkable
change in its nature as well as in its resources,
the sensuous process of working upwards from particular
facts to general principles, will always be more
attractive than the ideal process of working downwards
from principles to facts. In both cases, there is, no
doubt, a line of argument essentially ideal; just as, in
both cases, there is an assemblage of facts essentially
sensuous. No method is pure, or stands entirely by itself.
But, inasmuch as, in induction, the facts are more prominent
than the ideas, while, in deduction, the ideas are
more prominent than the facts, it is evident that conclusions
arrived at by the former plan will, as a general
rule, obtain a wider assent than conclusions arrived at
by the latter plan. Obtaining a wider assent, they will
produce more decisive results, and will be more likely
to shape the national character and influence the course
of national affairs.</p>

<p>The only exception to this, is theology. There, the
inductive method, as I have already observed, is inapplicable,
and nothing remains but deduction, which is
quite sufficient for the purposes of the theologian. For,
he has a peculiar resource which supplies him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
general principles, from which he can argue; and the
possession of this resource forms the fundamental difference
between him and the man of science. Science
is the result of inquiry; theology is the result of faith.
In the one, the spirit of doubt; in the other, the spirit
of belief. In science, originality is the parent of discovery,
and is, therefore, a merit; in theology, it is the
parent of heresy, and is, therefore, a crime. Every
system of religion the world has yet seen, recognizes
faith as an indispensable duty; but to every system of
science it is a hindrance, instead of a duty, inasmuch
as it discourages those inquisitive and innovating habits
on which all intellectual progress depends. The theologian,
thus turning credulity into an honour, and
valuing men in proportion as they are simple-minded
and easy of belief, has little need to trouble himself
with facts, which, indeed, he sets at open defiance, in
his eagerness to narrate portentous, and often miraculous,
events. To the inductive philosopher such a license
is forbidden. He is obliged to ground his inferences on
facts which no one disputes, or which, at all events,
any one can either verify for himself, or see verified by
others. And if he does not adopt this course, his inferences,
be they ever so true, will have the greatest
difficulty in working themselves into the popular mind,
because they will savour of a subtlety and refinement
of thought, which, more than any thing else, predisposes
common understandings to reject the conclusions at
which philosophers arrive.</p>

<p>From the facts and arguments contained in this and
the preceding chapter, the reader will, I trust, be able
to see why it was that the Scotch intellect, during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was preëminently
deductive; and also why it was that, in the eighteenth
century, the Scotch literature, notwithstanding its brilliancy,
its power, and the splendid discoveries of which
it was the vehicle, produced little or no effect on the
nation at large. That literature, by its bold and innovating
character, seemed peculiarly fitted to disturb
ancient prejudices, and to rouse up a spirit of inquiry.
But its method, both of investigation and of proof, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
too refined to suit ordinary understandings. Therefore,
upon ordinary understandings it was inoperative. In
Scotland, as in ancient Greece, and in modern Germany,
the intellectual classes, being essentially deductive, have
been unable to influence the main body of the people.
They have considered things at too great an altitude,
and at too great a remove. In Greece, Aristotle alone
had a true idea of what induction really was. But
even he knew nothing of crucial instances and the
theory of averages, the two capital resources of that
inductive philosophy which we now possess. Neither
did he, nor any of the great German philosophers, nor
any of the great Scotch philosophers, attach sufficient
importance to the slow and cautious method of gradually
rising from each generalization to the one immediately
above it, without omitting any intermediate
generalizations. On this method, Bacon, indeed, insists
too strongly, since many most important discoveries
have been made independently of it, or, I should rather
say, in contradiction to it. But it is a wonderful weapon,
and none except men of real genius can dispense with
its use. And when they do dispense with it, they cut
themselves off from the general sympathies of their
age and country. For, these small and proximate generalizations,
which they neglect, are precisely those parts
of philosophy which, being least removed from the
region of visible facts, are best understood by the
people, and, therefore, form the only common ground
between thinkers and practitioners. They are a sort
of middle term, which, being comprehended by both
classes, is accessible to either. In all deductive reasoning,
this intermediate, and, if I may so say, neutral,
territory disappears, and the two classes have no
meeting-place. Hence it is, that the Scotch philosophy,
like the German philosophy, and like the Greek
philosophy, has had no national influence. But in
England, since the seventeenth century, and in France,
since the eighteenth century, the prevailing philosophy
has been inductive, and has, therefore, not only affected
the intellectual classes, but also moved the public mind.
The German philosophers are far superior, both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
depth and in comprehensiveness, to the philosophers
either of France or of England. Their profound researches
have, however, done so little for their country,
that the German people are every way inferior to the
French and English people. So, too, in the philosophy
of ancient Greece, we find a vast body of massive and
original thought, and, what is infinitely better, we find
a boldness of inquiry and a passionate love of truth,
such as no modern nation has surpassed, and few modern
nations have equalled. But the method of that philosophy
was an insuperable barrier to its propagation.
The people were untouched, and went grovelling on in
their old folly, a prey to superstitions, most of which
the great thinkers despised, and often attacked, but
could by no means root out. Bad, however, as those
superstitions were, we may confidently say that they
were less noxious, that is, less detrimental to the happiness
of man, than the repulsive and horrible notions
advocated by the Scotch clergy, and sanctioned by the
Scotch people. And on those notions the Scotch philosophy
could make no impression. In Scotland, during
the eighteenth century, superstition and science, the
most irreconcilable of all enemies, flourished side by
side, unable to weaken each other, and unable, indeed,
to come into collision with each other. There was co-existence
without contact. The two forces kept apart,
and the result was, that, while the Scotch thinkers
were creating a noble and most enlightened literature,
the Scotch people, refusing to listen to those great
masters of wisdom which their country possessed,
remained in darkness, leaving the blind to follow the
blind, and no one there to help them.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, curious to observe how little effect was
produced by the many great works written by Scotchmen
in the eighteenth century. If we except the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, I can hardly call to mind one which
has perceptibly influenced public opinion. The reason
of this exception may be easily explained. The <i>Wealth
of Nations</i> restricted the action of government within
narrower limits than had ever been assigned to it by
any other book of great merit. No previous political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
writer of admitted genius, had left so much to the
people, and had demanded for them so much liberty in
managing their own affairs, as Adam Smith did. The
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, being thus eminently a democratic
book, was sure to find favour in Scotland, which was
eminently a democratic country. Directly men heard
its conclusions, they were prejudiced in favour of its
arguments. So, too, in England, that love of liberty,
which for many centuries has been our leading characteristic,
and which does us more real honour than all
our conquests, all our literature, and all our philosophy
put together, invariably causes a popular bias on behalf
of any claim to freedom. We, therefore, notwithstanding
the activity of interested parties, were predisposed
to the side of free trade, as one of the means of letting
each man do what he liked with his own. But to
imagine that ordinary minds are capable of mastering
such a work as the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, and of following
without confusion its long and intricate arguments, is
simply absurd. It has been read by tens of thousands
of persons, who accept its conclusions because they like
them; which is merely saying, because the movement of
the age tends that way. The other great work of Adam
Smith, namely, the <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>, has had
no influence except on a very small class of metaphysicians,
although its style is, as some think, superior
to the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, and it is certainly easier to
understand. It is, moreover, much shorter, which, to
most readers, is no small recommendation; and it deals
with subjects of great interest, which come home to
the feelings of all. But the age, not caring for its conclusions,
neglected its arguments. On the other hand,
the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> harmonized with the general
tendency, and its success was supreme. It quickly
moved, not only philosophers, but even statesmen and
politicians, who eventually put into force its leading recommendations,
though, as their laws and their speeches
abundantly prove, they have never succeeded in
mastering those great principles which underlie it,
and of which the freedom of trade is but a minor
accessory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>Putting aside the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, we shall find
that the Scotch literature of the eighteenth century did
scarcely any thing for Scotland, considered as a whole.
How it has failed in its great aim of weakening superstition,
is but too apparent to whoever has travelled in
that country, and observed the habits and turn of mind
still predominant. Many able and enlightened men who
lived there, are so cowed by the general spirit, that, for
their own comfort, and for the peace of their families,
they make no resistance, but tacitly comply with what
they heartily despise. That they err in doing so, I, at
least, firmly believe; though I know that many honest,
and in every respect competent, judges are of opinion,
that no man is bound to be a martyr, or to jeopardize
his personal interests, unless he clearly sees his way to
some immediate public good. To me, however, it appears
that this is a narrow view, and that the first duty
of every one is to set his face in direct opposition to
what he believes to be false, and, having done that,
leave the results of his conduct to take care of themselves.
Still, the temptation to a contrary course is
always very strong, and, in a country like Scotland, is
by many deemed irresistible. In no other Protestant
nation, and, indeed, in no Catholic nation except Spain,
will a man who is known to hold unorthodox opinions,
find his life equally uncomfortable. In a few of the
large towns, he may possibly escape animadversion, if
his sentiments are not too bold, and are not too openly
expressed. If he is timid and taciturn, his heresy may,
perchance, be overlooked. But even in large towns, impunity
is the exception, and not the rule. Even in the
capital of Scotland, in that centre of intelligence which
once boasted of being the Modern Athens, a whisper
will quickly circulate that such an one is to be avoided,
for that he is a free-thinker; as if free-thinking were a
crime, or as if it were not better to be a free-thinker
than a slavish thinker. In other parts, that is, in
Scotland generally, the state of things is far worse. I
speak, not on vague rumour, but from what I know
as existing at the present time, and for the accuracy
of which I vouch and hold myself responsible. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
challenge any one to contradict my assertion, when I
say that, at this moment, nearly all over Scotland, the
finger of scorn is pointed at every man, who, in the
exercise of his sacred and inalienable right of free
judgment, refuses to acquiesce in those religious notions,
and to practise those religious customs, which
time, indeed, has consecrated, but many of which are
repulsive to the eye of reason, though to all of them,
however irrational they maybe, the people adhere with
sullen and inflexible obstinacy. Knowing that these
words will be widely read and circulated in Scotland,
and averse as I naturally am to bring on myself the
hostility of a nation, for whose many sterling and valuable
qualities I entertain sincere respect, I do, nevertheless,
deliberately affirm, that in no civilized country is
toleration so little understood, and that in none is the
spirit of bigotry and of persecution so extensively diffused.
Nor can any one wonder that such should be
the case, who observes what is going on there. The
churches are as crowded as they were in the Middle
Ages, and are filled with devout and ignorant worshippers,
who flock together to listen to opinions of which
the Middle Ages alone were worthy. Those opinions
they treasure up, and, when they return to their homes,
or enter into the daily business of life, they put them in
force. And the result is, that there runs through the
entire country a sour and fanatical spirit, an aversion
to innocent gaiety, a disposition to limit the enjoyments
of others, and a love of inquiring into the opinions of
others, and of interfering with them, such as is hardly
anywhere else to be found; while, in the midst of
all this, there flourishes a national creed, gloomy and
austere to the last degree, a creed which is full of forebodings
and threats and horrors of every sort, and
which rejoices in proclaiming to mankind how wretched
and miserable they are, how small a portion of them
can be saved, and what an overwhelming majority is
necessarily reserved for excruciating, unspeakable, and
eternal agony.</p>

<p>Before bringing this volume to a close, it may be
fitting that I should narrate an event, which, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
its recent occurrence, and the great attention it
excited at the time, has, amid the pressure of weightier
matters, fallen into comparative oblivion, although it is
full of interest to those who study the various forms of
national character, while it, moreover, supplies an admirable
illustration of the essential antagonism which
still exists between the Scotch and English minds; an
antagonism extremely remarkable, when found among
nations, both of whom, besides being contiguous, and
constantly mixing together, speak the same language,
read the same books, belong to the same empire, and
possess the same interests, and yet are, in many important
respects, as different as if there had never been
any means of their influencing each other, and as if
they had never had any thing in common.</p>

<p>In the year 1853, the cholera, after having committed
serious ravages in many parts of Europe, visited
Scotland. There, it was sure to find numerous victims
among a badly fed, badly housed, and not over-cleanly
people. For, if there is one thing better established
than another respecting this disease, it is that it invariably
attacks, with the greatest effect, those classes
who, from poverty or from sloth, are imperfectly
nourished, neglect their persons, and live in dirty,
ill-drained, or ill-ventilated dwellings. In Scotland,
such classes are very numerous. In Scotland, therefore,
the cholera must needs be very fatal. In this,
there was nothing mysterious. On the contrary, the
mystery would have been if an epidemic, like the
Asiatic cholera, had spared a country like Scotland,
where all the materials were collected on which pestilence
feeds, and where filth, penury, and disorder,
abound on every side.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it must have been evident,
not merely to men of science, but to all men of
plain, sound understanding, who would apply their
minds to the matter without prejudice, that the Scotch
had only one way of successfully grappling with their
terrible enemy. It behoved them to feed their poor,
to cleanse their cesspools, and to ventilate their houses.
If they had done this, and done it quickly, thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
of lives would have been spared. But they neglected
it, and the country was thrown into mourning. Nay,
they not only neglected it, but, moved by the dire
superstition which sits like an incubus upon them,
they adopted a course which, if it had been carried
into full operation, would have aggravated the calamity
to a frightful extent. It is well known that, whenever
an epidemic is raging, physical exhaustion and mental
depression make the human frame more liable to it,
and are, therefore, especially to be guarded against.
But, though this is a matter of common notoriety, the
Scotch clergy, backed, sad to say, by the general voice
of the Scotch people, wished the public authorities to
take a step which was certain to cause physical exhaustion,
and to encourage mental depression. In the
name of religion, whose offices they thus abused and
perverted to the detriment of man, instead of employing
them for his benefit, they insisted on the propriety
of ordering a national fast, which, in so superstitious a
country, was sure to be rigidly kept, and, being rigidly
kept, was equally sure to enfeeble thousands of delicate
persons, and, before twenty-four hours were passed,
prepare them to receive that deadly poison which was
already lurking around them, and which, hitherto, they
had just strength enough to resist. The public fast
was also to be accompanied by a public humiliation,
in order that nothing might be wanting to appal the
mind and fill it with terror. On the same occasion,
the preachers were to thunder from their pulpits and
proclaim aloud the sins of the land; while the poor
benighted people, panic-struck, were to sit in awe, were
to remain the whole day without proper nourishment,
and retire to their beds, weeping and starved. Then it
was hoped that the Deity would be propitiated, and the
plague be stayed. As soon as the entire nation had
taken the course, which, of all others, was most certain
to increase the mortality, it was believed that man
having done his worst, the Almighty would interpose,
would violate the laws of nature, and, by working a
miracle, would preserve his creatures from what, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
a miracle, would be the inevitable consequence of
their own deliberate act.</p>

<p>This was the scheme projected by the Scotch clergy,
and they were determined to put it into execution. To
give greater effect to it, they called upon England to
help them, and, in the autumn of 1853, the Presbytery
of Edinburgh, thinking that from their position they
were bound to take the lead, caused their Moderator to
address a letter, ostensibly to the English Minister, but
in reality to the English nation. In this choice production,
a copy of which is now lying before me, the
Home Secretary is assured that the members of the
Presbytery had delayed appointing a day for fasting
and humiliation on their own ecclesiastical authority,
because they thought it likely that one would be appointed
by the royal authority. But as this had not
been done, the Presbytery respectfully requested to be
informed if it was intended to be done. They apologized
for the liberty they were taking; they had no
desire unduly to intrude themselves; neither did they
wish the Home Secretary to answer their question unless
he felt himself justified in doing so. Still, if he
were able to answer it, they would be glad. For, there
was no doubt that Asiatic cholera was in the country;
and such being the case, the Presbytery of Edinburgh
were interested in knowing if the appointment by the
Queen of a national fast was in contemplation.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>This letter, which, through the medium of the press,
was sure to become well known and to be widely read,
was evidently intended to act on public opinion in
England. It was, in fact, a covert reproach on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
English Government for having neglected its spiritual
duties, and for not having perceived that fasting was
the most effectual way of stopping an epidemic. In
Scotland, generally, it received great praise, and was
regarded as a dignified rebuke addressed to the irreligious
habits of the English people, who, seeing the
cholera at their doors, merely occupied themselves with
sanatory measures, and carnal devices to improve the
public health, showing thereby that they trusted too
much to the arms of the flesh. In England, on the
other hand, this manifesto of the Scotch Church was
met with almost universal ridicule, and, indeed, found
no favourers except among the most ignorant and credulous
part of the nation. The minister to whom it
was addressed, was Lord Palmerston, a man of vast
experience, and perhaps better acquainted with public
opinion than any politician of his time. He, being
well aware of the difference between Scotland and
England, knew that what was suitable for one country
was not suitable for the other, and that notions which
the Scotch deemed religious, the English deemed fanatical.
On a former occasion, the imperial government,
yielding to the clamour which a few active and interested
men succeeded in raising, had been foolish
enough to set themselves in this matter in opposition
to the temper of the age, and to enjoin public observances
which, happily, were not strictly obeyed, but
which, in so far as they were obeyed, heightened the
general terror by reinforcing natural fears with supernatural
ones, and thus, depressing the nervous system,
increased the chance of mortality from the pestilence.
To have the plague in our country is bad enough,
since, do what we may, many victims will be struck
down by it. But a fearful responsibility is entailed
upon those who, at such a period, instead of exerting
themselves to check its ravages, either by precautionary
measures, or by soothing and re-assuring the people, do
every thing in their power to aggravate the calamity,
by encouraging that superstitious dread which weakens
the popular energy at the very moment when energy
is most requisite, and troubles the coolness, the self-reliance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
and self-possession, without which no crisis of
national danger can ever be averted.</p>

<p>This time, however, there was no risk of the government
committing so serious a blunder. Lord Palmerston,
who knew that the sound sense of the English
people would support him in what he was doing,
directed a letter to be sent to the Presbytery of Edinburgh,
which, unless I am greatly mistaken, will, in
future ages, be quoted as an interesting document for
illustrating the history of the progress of public opinion.
A century ago, any statesman who had written such a
letter, would have been driven from office by a storm
of general indignation. Two centuries ago, the consequences
to him would have been still more disastrous,
and would, indeed, have ruined him socially, as well as
politically. For, in it, he sets at defiance those superstitious
fancies respecting the origin of disease, which
were once universally cherished as an essential part of
every religious creed. Traditions, the memory of which
is preserved in the theological literature of all Pagan
countries, of all Catholic countries, and of all Protestant
countries, are quietly put aside, as if they were
matters of no moment, and as if it were not worth
while to discuss them. The Scotch clergy, occupying
the old ground on which the members of their profession
had always been accustomed to stand, took for
granted that the cholera was the result of the divine
anger, and was intended to chastise our sins. In the
reply which they now received from the English
Government, a doctrine was enunciated, which to
Englishmen seems right enough, but which to Scotchmen
sounded very profane. The Presbytery were informed,
that the affairs of this world are regulated by
natural laws, on the observance or neglect of which
the weal or woe of mankind depends.<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> One of those
laws connects disease with the exhalations of bodies;
and it is by virtue of this law that contagion spreads,
either in crowded cities, or in places where vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
decomposition is going on. Man, by exerting himself,
can disperse or neutralize these noxious influences.
The appearance of the cholera proves that he has not
exerted himself. The towns have not been purified;
hence the root of the evil. The Home Secretary, therefore,
advised the Presbytery of Edinburgh, that it was
better to cleanse than to fast. He thought that the
plague being upon them, activity was preferable to
humiliation. It was now autumn, and before the hot
weather would return, a considerable period must
elapse. That period should be employed in destroying
the causes of disease, by improving the abodes of the
poor. If this were done, all would go well. Otherwise,
pestilence would be sure to revisit them, &lsquo;in
spite&rsquo;&mdash;I quote the words of the English minister&mdash;&lsquo;in
spite of all the prayers and fastings of a united, but
inactive nation.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a></p>

<p>This correspondence between the Scotch clergy and
the English statesman, is not to be regarded as a mere
passing episode of light or temporary interest. On the
contrary, it represents that terrible struggle between
theology and science, which, having begun in the persecution
of science, and in the martyrdom of scientific
men, has, in these later days, taken a happier turn, and
is now manifestly destroying that old theological spirit,
which has brought so much misery and ruin upon the
world. The ancient superstition, which was once universal,
but is now slowly though surely dying away, represented
the Deity as being constantly moved to anger,
delighting in seeing His creatures abase and mortify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
themselves, taking pleasure in their sacrifices and their
austerities, and, notwithstanding all they could do,
constantly inflicting on them the most grievous punishments,
among which the different forms of pestilence
were conspicuous. It is by science, and by science
alone, that these horrible delusions are being dissipated.
Events, which formerly were deemed supernatural
visitations, are now shown to depend upon natural
causes, and to be amenable to natural remedies. Man
can predict them, and man can deal with them. Being
the inevitable result of their own antecedents, no room
is left for the notion of their being special inflictions.
This great change in our opinions is fatal to theology,
but is serviceable to religion. For, by it, science, instead
of being the enemy of religion, becomes its ally.
Religion is to each individual according to the inward
light with which he is endowed. In different characters,
therefore, it assumes different forms, and can
never be reduced to one common and arbitrary rule.
Theology, on the other hand, claiming authority over
all minds, and refusing to recognize their essential
divergence, seeks to compel them to a single creed, and
sets up one standard of absolute truth, by which it
tests every one's opinions; presumptuously condemning
those who disagree with that standard. Such
arrogant pretensions need means of support. Those
means are threats, which, in ignorant times, are universally
believed, and which, by causing fear, produce
submission. Hence it is, that the books of every theological
system narrate acts of the grossest cruelty,
which, without the least hesitation, are ascribed to the
direct interposition of God. Humane and gentle natures
revolt at such cruelties, even while they try to
believe them. It is the business of science to purify
theology, by showing that there has been no cruelty,
because there has been no interposition. Science
ascribes to natural causes, what theology ascribes to
supernatural ones. According to this view the calamities
with which the world is afflicted, are the result of
the ignorance of man, and not of the interference of
God. We must not, therefore, ascribe to Him what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
due to our own folly, or to our own vice. We must
not calumniate an all-wise and all-merciful Being, by
imputing to Him those little passions which move ourselves,
as if He were capable of rage, of jealousy, and
of revenge, and as if He, with outstretched arm, were
constantly employed in aggravating the sufferings of
mankind, and making the miseries of the human race
more poignant than they would otherwise be.</p>

<p>That this remarkable improvement in religious ideas
is due to the progress of physical science, is apparent,
not only from general arguments which would lead us
to anticipate that such must be the case, but also from
the historical fact, that the gradual destruction of the
old theology is everywhere preceded by the growth
and diffusion of physical truths. The more we know
of the laws of nature, the more clearly do we understand
that every thing which happens in the material
world, pestilence, earthquake, famine, or whatever it
may be, is the necessary result of something which had
previously happened. Cause produces effect, and the
effect becomes, in its turn, a cause of other effects. In
that operation, we see no gap, and we admit of no
pause. To us, the chain is unbroken; the constancy
of nature is unviolated. Our minds become habituated
to contemplate all physical phenomena as presenting an
orderly, uniform, and spontaneous march, and running
on in one regular and uninterrupted sequence. This is
the scientific view. It is also the religious view.
Against it, we have the theological view; but that
which has already lost its hold over the intellect of men
is now losing its hold over their affections, and is so
manifestly perishing, that at present no educated person
ventures to defend it, without so limiting and
guarding his meaning, as to concede to its opponents
nearly every point which is really at issue.</p>

<p>While, however, in regard to the material world, the
narrow notions formerly entertained, are, in the most
enlightened countries, almost extinct, it must be confessed
that, in regard to the moral world, the progress
of opinion is less rapid. The same men who believe
that Nature is undisturbed by miraculous interposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
refuse to believe that man is equally undisturbed. In
the one case, they assert the scientific doctrine of
regularity; in the other, they assert the theological
doctrine of irregularity. The reason of this difference
of opinion is, that the movements of nature are less
complex than the movements of man. Being less
complex, they are more easily studied, and more quickly
understood. Hence we find, that while natural science
has long been cultivated, historical science hardly yet
exists. Our knowledge of the circumstances which
determine the course of mankind, is still so imperfect,
and has been so badly digested, that it has produced
scarcely any effect on popular ideas. Philosophers, indeed,
are aware, that here, as elsewhere, there must be
a necessary connexion between even the most remote
and dissimilar events. They know that every discrepancy
is capable of being reconciled, though we, in
the present state of knowledge, may be unequal to the
task. This is their faith, and nothing can wean them
from it. But the great majority of people have a different
faith. They believe that what is unexplained is
inexplicable, and that what is inexplicable is supernatural.
Science has explained an immense number
of physical phenomena, and therefore, even to the
vulgar, those phenomena no longer seem supernatural,
but are ascribed to natural causes. On the other hand,
science has not yet explained the phenomena of history;
consequently, the theological spirit lays hold of them,
and presses them into its own service. In this way
there has arisen that famous and ancient theory, which
has received the name of the moral government of the
world. It is a high-sounding title, and imposes on
many, who, if they examined its pretensions, would
never be duped by them. For, like that other notion
which we have just considered, it is not only unscientific,
but it is eminently irreligious. It is, in fact,
an impeachment of one of the noblest attributes of the
Deity. It is a slur on the Omniscience of God. It
assumes that the fate of nations, instead of being the
result of preceding and surrounding events, is specially
subject to the control and interference of Providence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
It assumes that there are great public emergencies, in
which such interference is needed. It assumes, that,
without the interference, the course of affairs could not
run smoothly; that they would be jangled and out of
tune; that the play and harmony of the whole would
be incomplete. And thus it is, that the very men who,
at one moment, proclaim the Divine Omniscience, do,
at the next moment, advocate a theory which reduces
that Omniscience to nothing, since it imputes to an
All-wise Being, that the scheme of human affairs, of
which He must, from the beginning, have foreseen every
issue and every consequence, is so weakly contrived as
to be liable to be frustrated; that it has not turned out
as He could have wished; that it has been baffled by
His own creatures, and that, to preserve its integrity,
its operations must be tampered with, and its disorders
redressed. The great Architect of the universe, the
Creator and Designer of all existing things, is likened
to some clumsy mechanic, who knows his trade so ill,
that he has to be called in to alter the working of his
own machine, to supply its deficiencies, to fill up its
flaws, and to rectify its errors.</p>

<p>It is time that such unworthy notions should come
to an end. It is time that what has long been known
to philosophers, should also be known to historians, and
that the history of mankind should cease to be troubled
by what, to those who are imbued with the scientific
spirit, must seem little better than arrant trifling. Of
two things, choose one. Either deny the Omniscience of
the Creator, or else admit it. If you deny it, you deny
what, to my mind at least, is a fundamental truth, and,
on these matters, there can be no sympathy between us.
But if you admit the Omniscience of God, beware of
libelling what you profess to defend. For when you
assert what is termed the moral government of the
world, you slander Omniscience, inasmuch as you declare
that the mechanism of the entire universe, including
the actions both of Nature and of Man, planned as it is
by Infinite Wisdom, is unequal to its duties, unless that
same Wisdom does from time to time interfere with it.
You assert, in fact, either that Omniscience has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
deceived, or that Omnipotence has been defeated. Surely,
they who believe, and whose pride and happiness it is to
believe, that there is a Power above all and before all,
knowing all and creating all, ought not to fall into such
a snare as this. They who, dissatisfied with this little
world of sense, seek to raise their minds to something
which the senses are unable to grasp, can hardly fail, on
deeper reflection, to perceive how coarse and material
is that theological prejudice, which ascribes to such a
Power the vulgar functions of a temporal ruler, arrays
him in the garb of an earthly potentate, and represents
him as meddling here and meddling there, uttering
threats, inflicting punishments, bestowing rewards.
These are base and grovelling conceptions, the offspring
of ignorance and of darkness. Such gross and sordid
notions are but one remove from actual idolatry. They
are the draff and offal of a bygone age, and we will
not have them obtruded here. Well suited they were
to those old and barbarous times, when men, being
unable to refine their ideas, were, therefore, unable to
purify their creed. Now, however, they jar upon us;
they do not assimilate with other parts of our knowledge;
they are incongruous; their concord is gone. Every
thing is against them. They stand alone; there is
nothing left with which they harmonize. The whole
scope and tendency of modern thought force upon our
minds conceptions of regularity and of law, to which they
are diametrically opposed. Even those who cling to
them, do so from the influence of tradition, rather than
from complete and unswerving belief. That child-like
and unhesitating faith, with which the doctrine of interposition
was once received, is succeeded by a cold and
lifeless assent, very different from the enthusiasm of
former times. Soon, too, this will vanish, and men
will cease to be terrified by phantoms which their own
ignorance has reared. This age, haply, may not witness
the emancipation; but, so surely as the human
mind advances, so surely will that emancipation come.
It may come quicker than any one expects. For, we
are stepping on far and fast. The signs of the time
are all around, and they who list may read. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
handwriting is on the wall; the fiat has gone forth;
the ancient empire shall be subverted; the dominion
of superstition, already decaying, shall break away,
and crumble into dust; and new life being breathed
into the confused and chaotic mass, it shall be clearly
seen, that, from the beginning, there has been no discrepancy,
no incongruity, no disorder, no interruption,
no interference; but that all the events which surround
us, even to the furthest limits of the material creation,
are but different parts of a single scheme, which is
permeated by one glorious principle of universal and
undeviating regularity.</p>

theological bearings. Some of the Bridgewater Treatises, such as Bell's,
Buckland's, and Prout's, had great scientific merit at the time of their
appearance, and may even now be studied with advantage; but the
religious portion of them is pitiable, and shows either that their heart
was not in their work, or else that the subject was too wide for them.
At all events, it is to be hoped that we shall never again see men of
equal eminence hiring themselves out as paid advocates, and receiving
fees to support particular opinions. It is truly disgraceful that such
great speculative questions, instead of being subjected to fair and
disinterested argument, with a view of eliciting the truth, should be
turned into a pecuniary transaction, in which any one of much money and
little wit, can bribe as many persons as he likes, to prejudice the
public ear in favour of his own theories.</p></div>

comets which we derive from Scotch writers down to this time (1682)
contain nothing but accounts of the popular fancies regarding them.
Practical astronomy seems to have then been unknown in our country; and
hence, while in other lands, men were carefully observing, computing,
and approaching to just conclusions regarding these illustrious
strangers of the sky, our diarists could only tell us how many <i>yards</i>
long they seemed to be, what <i>effects</i> were apprehended from them in the
way of war and pestilence, and how certain pious divines &ldquo;improved&rdquo; them
for spiritual edification. Early in this century Scotland had produced
one great philosopher, who had supplied his craft with the mathematical
instruments by which complex problems, such as the movement of comets,
were alone to be solved. It might have been expected that the country of
Napier, seventy years after his time, would have had many sons capable
of applying his key to such mysteries of nature. But no one had
arisen&mdash;nor did any rise for fifty years onward, when at length Colin
Maclaurin unfolded in the Edinburgh University the sublime philosophy of
Newton. There could not be a more expressive signification of the
character of the seventeenth century in Scotland. Our unhappy
contentions about external religious matters had absorbed the whole
genius of the people, rendering to us the age of Cowley, of Waller, and
of Milton, as barren of elegant literature, as that of Horrocks, of
Halley, and of Newton, was of science.&rsquo; <i>Chambers' Domestic Annals of

were gradually refining their language and their taste; in Scotland, the

<p>&lsquo;But the taste and science, the genius and the learning of the age, were

shall examine it carefully and in detail. The revival of the old logic
is a great symptom of it. Works like those of Whately, De Morgan, and
Mansel, could not have been produced in tho eighteenth century, or, at
all events, if by some extraordinary combination of events they had been
produced, they would have found no readers. As it is, they have
exercised a very extensive and very salutary influence; and, although
Archbishop Whately was not well acquainted with the history of formal
logic, his exposition of its ordinary processes is so admirably clear,
that he has probably contributed more than any other man towards
impressing his contemporaries with a sense of the value of deductive
reasoning. He has, however, not done sufficient justice to the opposite
school, and has, indeed, fallen into the old academical error of
supposing that all reasoning is by syllogism. We might just as well say
that all movement is by descent.</p></div>

that course of action which tends most effectually to promote their
greatest happiness and perfection; as far as it can be done by
observations and conclusions discoverable from the constitution of

his own opinions, speculative or practical, to judge according to the
evidence that appears to him. This right appears from the very
constitution of the rational mind, which can assent or dissent solely
according to the evidence presented, and naturally desires knowledge.
The same considerations show this right to be unalienable: it
cannot be subjected to the will of another: though where there is
a previous judgment formed concerning the superior wisdom of another, or
his infallibility, the opinion of this other, to a weak mind, may become
sufficient evidence. As to opinions about the Deity, religion, and
virtue, this right is further confirmed by all the noblest desires of
the soul; as there can be no virtue, but rather impiety in not adhering
to the opinions we think just, and in professing the contrary.&rsquo;
<i>Hutcheson's Moral Philosophy</i>, vol. i. pp. 295, 296. See also vol. ii.

appears to them, and cannot command their own assent in opposition to
it, this right is plainly unalienable.&rsquo;</p></div>

perjuries, frauds, massacres, assassinations, they have ever either
heard of, or read in history; thence concluding all mankind to be very
wicked; as if a court of justice were the proper place for making an
estimate of the morals of mankind, or an hospital of the healthfulness
of a climate. Ought they not to consider that the number of honest
citizens and farmers far surpasses that of all sorts of criminals in any
state; and that the innocent or kind actions of even criminals
themselves, surpass their crimes in numbers? That it is the rarity of
crimes, in comparison of innocent or good actions, which engages our
attention to them, and makes them be recorded in history; while
incomparably more honest, generous, domestic actions are overlooked,
only because they are so common; as one great danger, or one month's
sickness, shall become a frequently repeated story, during a long life
of health and safety.&rsquo;</p></div>

considered in the most elevated manner, rests on ideas, and from that
point of view is impregnable, unless the axioms can be overthrown. But
if geometricians will insist on having definitions as well as axioms,
they gain, no doubt, increased clearness, but they lose something in
accuracy. I apprehend that, without definitions, geometry could not be a
science of space, but would be a science of magnitudes, ideally
conceived and consequently as pure as ratiocination could make it. This

distinction of ranks has once been completely established, there have
been always two different schemes or systems of morality current at the
same time; of which the one may be called the strict or austere; the
other the liberal, or, if you will, the loose system. The former is
generally revered and admired by the common people; the latter is
commonly more esteemed and adopted by what are called the people of
fashion. The degree of disapprobation with which we ought to mark the
vices of levity, the vices which are apt to arise from great prosperity,
and from the excess of gaiety and good humour, seems to constitute the
principal distinction between those two opposite schemes or systems. In
the liberal, or loose system, luxury, wanton, and even disorderly mirth,
the pursuit of pleasure to some degree of intemperance, the breach of
chastity, at least in one of the two sexes, provided they are not
accompanied with gross indecency, and do not lead to falsehood and
injustice, are generally treated with a good deal of indulgence, and are
easily either excused or pardoned altogether. In the austere system, on
the contrary, these excesses are regarded with the utmost abhorrence and
detestation. The vices of levity are always ruinous to the common
people, and a single week's thoughtlessness and dissipation is often
sufficient to undo a poor workman for ever, and to drive him, through
despair, upon committing the most enormous crimes. The wiser and better
sort of the common people, therefore, have always the utmost abhorrence
and detestation of such excesses, which their experience tells them are
so immediately fatal to people of their condition. The disorder and
extravagance of several years, on the contrary, will not always ruin a
man of fashion; and people of that rank are very apt to consider the
power of indulging in some degree of excess, as one of the advantages of
their fortune; and the liberty of doing so without censure or reproach,
as one of the privileges which belong to their station. In people of
their own station, therefore, they regard such excesses with but a small
degree of disapprobation, and censure them either very slightly or not
at all.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Almost all religious sects have begun among the common people, from
whom they have generally drawn their earliest as well as their most
numerous proselytes. The austere system of morality has, accordingly,
been adopted by those sects almost constantly, or with very few
exceptions; for there have been some. It was the system by which they
could best recommend themselves to that order of people, to whom they
first proposed their plan of reformation upon what had been before
established. Many of them, perhaps the greater part of them, have even
endeavoured to gain credit by refining upon this austere system, and by
carrying it to some degree of folly and extravagance; and this excessive
rigour has frequently recommended them, more than any thing else, to the
respect and veneration of the common people.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;In little religious
sects, accordingly, the morals of the common people have been almost
always remarkably regular and orderly; generally much more so than in
the established church. The morals of those little sects, indeed, have
frequently been rather disagreeably rigorous and unsocial.&rsquo; <i>Wealth of
Nations</i>, book v. chap. i. pp. 332, 333.</p></div>

them can be very great; and this mediocrity of benefice, though it may,
no doubt, be carried too far, has, however, some very agreeable effects.
Nothing but exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune.
The vices of levity and vanity necessarily render him ridiculous, and
are, besides, almost as ruinous to him as they are to the common people.
In his own conduct, therefore, he is obliged to follow that system of
morals which the common people respect the most. He gains their esteem
and affection, by that plan of life which his own interest and situation
would lead him to follow.&rsquo; <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, book v. chap. i. p.

masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines,
upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the
world as of the subject. Masters are always and every where in a sort of
tacit, but constant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of
labour above their actual rate. To violate this combination is every
where a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among
his neighbours and equals. We seldom, indeed, hear of this combination,
because it is the usual, and, one may say, the natural state of things
which nobody ever hears of. Masters, too, sometimes enter into
particular combinations to sink the wages of labour even below this
rate.&rsquo; <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, book i. chap. viii. p. 28.</p></div>

distinction, even in the lowest species of labour, between summer and
winter wages. Summer wages are always highest. But, on account of the
extraordinary expense of fuel, the maintenance of a family is most
expensive in winter. Wages, therefore, being highest when this expense
is lowest, it seems evident that they are not regulated by what is
necessary for this expense, but by the quantity and supposed value of
the work.&rsquo; <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, book i. chap. viii. p. 31.</p></div>

subsistence make all such people eager to return to service. But the
high price of provisions, by diminishing the funds destined for the

increase the number of those they have.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Masters of all sorts,
therefore, frequently make better bargains with their servants in dear
than in cheap years, and find them more humble and dependent in the
former than in the latter. They naturally, therefore, commend the former
as more favourable to industry.&rsquo; <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, book i. chap.

their persons, and yet reward their talents with the most profuse
liberality. While we do the one, however, we must of necessity do the
other. Should the public opinion, or prejudice, ever alter with regard
to such occupation, their pecuniary recompense would quickly diminish.
More people would apply to them, and the competition would quickly
reduce the price of their labour. Such talents, though far from being
common, are by no means so rare as imagined. Many people possess them in
great perfection, who disdain to make this use of them; and many more
are capable of acquiring them, if any thing could be made honourably by
them.&rsquo; <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, book i. ch. x. p. 44.</p></div>

possessed in the tithes a very large portion of the rents of all the
other estates in every kingdom of Europe. The revenues arising from both
those species of rents were, the greater part of them, paid in kind, in
corn, wine, cattle, poultry, &amp;c. The quantity exceeded greatly what the
clergy could themselves consume; and there were neither arts nor
manufactures, for the produce of which they could exchange the surplus.
The clergy could derive advantage from this immense surplus in no other
way than by employing it, as the great barons employed the like surplus
of their revenues, in the most profuse hospitality, and in the most
extensive charity. Both the hospitality and the charity of the ancient
clergy, accordingly, are said to have been very great.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The
hospitality and charity of the clergy, too, not only gave them the
command of a great temporal force, but increased very much the weight of
their spiritual weapons. Those virtues procured them the highest respect
and veneration among all the inferior ranks of people, of whom many were
constantly, and almost all occasionally, fed by them.&rsquo; <i>Wealth of

Hume grew, and the more he read on history, the more he became imbued
with these errors; which would not have been the case if the errors had,
as many of his critics say, been the result of an insufficient
acquaintance with the evidence. Mr. Burton, by comparing the different
editions of his <i>History of England</i>, has shown that he gradually became
less favourable to popular liberty; softening, or erasing, in later
editions, those expressions which seemed favourable to freedom.
<i>Burton's Life of Hume</i>, vol. ii. pp. 74&ndash;77. See also pp. 144, 434. In
his <i>Own Life</i>, p. xi (in vol. i. of <i>Hume's Works</i> Edinb. 1826), he
says: &lsquo;In a hundred alterations, which farther study, reading,
or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first Stuarts,
I have made all of them invariably the Tory side.&rsquo; In one of his
essays, he observes (<i>Philosophical Works</i>, vol. iv. p. 172) that &lsquo;there
is no enthusiasm among philosophers;&rsquo; a remark perfectly true, so far as
he was concerned, but very unjust towards the class of men to whom it
refers.</p></div>

the politicians of our time seem inclined to overrate them. Lord
Brougham, for instance, in his Life of Hume, says, of his political
economy, &lsquo;Mr. Hume is, beyond all doubt, the author of the modern
doctrines which now rule the world of science.&rsquo; <i>Brougham's Works</i>,
Glasgow, 1856, vol. ii. p. 176. But so far from this being
the case, the science of political economy has, since the time of Hume,
received such additions, that if that illustrious philosopher were to
rise from the dead, he would hardly be able to recognize it. To him,
many of its largest and most fundamental principles were entirely
unknown. Hume knew nothing of the causes which govern the accumulation
of wealth, and compel that accumulation to proceed with different speed
in different states of society; a fruitful and important study almost
entirely neglected until entered upon by Rae. Neither did Hume know
anything of the law of the ratio between population and wages; nor of
the ratio between wages and profits. He even supposes (<i>Philosophical
Works</i>, vol. iii. p. 299, Edinburgh, 1826) that it is possible for the
labouring classes by combination &lsquo;to heighten their wages;&rsquo; and again
(p. 319) that the richer a nation is, and the more trade it has, the
easier it will be for a poor country to undersell its manufactures,
because the poor nation enjoys the advantage of a &lsquo;low price of labour.&rsquo;
Elsewhere, he asserts that coin can be depreciated without raising
prices, and that a country, by taxing a foreign commodity, could
increase its own population. &lsquo;Were all our money, for instance,
recoined, and a penny's worth of silver taken from every shilling, the
new shilling would probably purchase every thing that could have been
bought by the old; the prices of every thing would thereby be insensibly
diminished; foreign trade enlivened; and domestic industry, by the
circulation of a great number of pounds and shillings, would receive
some increase and encouragement.&rsquo; <i>Philosophical Works</i>, vol. iii. p.
324. &lsquo;A tax on German linen encourages home manufactures, and thereby
multiplies our people and industry.&rsquo; p. 365. These are cardinal errors,
which go to the very root of political economy; and when we fairly
estimate what has been done by Malthus and Ricardo, it will be evident
that Hume's doctrines do not &lsquo;rule the world of science.&rsquo; This is no
disparagement of Hume, who, on the contrary, effected wonderful things,
considering the then state of knowledge. The mistake is, in imagining
that such a rapidly advancing science as political economy can be
governed by doctrines propounded more than a century ago.</p></div>

now, a knowledge of this truth is so little diffused, that, lately, when
Australia and California began to yield immense quantities of gold, a
notion was widely circulated that the interest of money would
consequently fall; although nothing can be more certain than that if
gold were to become as plentiful as iron, the interest of money would be
unaffected. The whole effect would fall upon price. The remarks on this
subject in <i>Ritchie's Life of Hume</i>, London, 1807, pp. 332, 333, are
interesting, as illustrating the slow progress of opinion, and the
difficulty which minds, not specially trained, experience when they
attempt to investigate these subjects.</p></div>

advance in commerce, than to look on the progress of their neighbours
with a suspicious eye, to consider all trading states as their rivals,
and to suppose that it is impossible for any of them to flourish, but at
their expense. In opposition to this narrow and malignant opinion, I
will venture to assert, that the increase of riches and commerce in any
one nation, instead of hurting, commonly promotes the riches and
commerce of all its neighbours.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;I go farther, and observe, that

however, very difficult to determine what Adam Smith's
opinion really was upon this subject, and how far he was aware that rent
did not enter into price. In one passage in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>
(book i. chap. vi. p. 21) he says of wages, profit, and rent, &lsquo;in every
society, the price of every commodity finally resolves itself into some
one or other, or all of those three parts; and <i>in every improved
society, all the three enter, more or less, as component parts, into the
price of the far greater part of commodities</i>.&rsquo; But in book i. chap. xi.
p. 61, he says, &lsquo;High or low wages and profit are the causes of high or
low price; high or low rent is the effect of it.&rsquo; This latter opinion we
now know to be the true one; it is, however, incompatible with that
expressed in the first passage. For, if rent is the effect of price, it
cannot be a component of it.</p></div>

on account of the promptitude of his pen in the correction of the
letters intrusted to him to copy.&rsquo; The latter part of this story is
improbable; the former part is certainly incorrect; since Hume himself

of the general voice of his contemporaries. &lsquo;His temper was calm, not to
say cold; but though none of his feelings were ardent, all were engaged
on the side of virtue. He was free from the slightest tincture of
malignity or meanness; his conduct was uniformly excellent.&rsquo;
<i>Mackintosh's Memoirs</i>, vol. ii. p. 162. A greater than Mackintosh, and
a man who knew Hume intimately, expresses himself in much warmer terms.
&lsquo;Upon the whole,&rsquo; writes Adam Smith,&mdash;&lsquo;Upon the whole, I have always
considered him, both in his lifetime and since his death, as approaching
as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps
the nature of human frailty will permit.&rsquo; <i>Hume's Philosophical Works</i>,
vol. i. p. xxv. Some notices of Hume will be found in an interesting
work just published. <i>Autobiography of Alexander Carlyle</i>, Edinburgh,
1860, pp. 272&ndash;278. But Carlyle, though a man of considerable practical
skill, was incapable of large views, and was, therefore, unable, I will
not say to measure, but even to conceive, the size of such an
understanding as that possessed by David Hume. Of his want of
speculative power, a decisive instance appears in his remarks on Adam
Smith. He gravely says (<i>Autobiography</i>, p. 281), &lsquo;Smith's fine writing
is chiefly displayed in his book on <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, which is the
pleasantest and most eloquent book on the subject. His <i>Wealth of
Nations</i>, from which he was judged to be an inventive genius of the
first order, is tedious and full of repetition. His separate essays in
the second volume have the air of being occasional pamphlets, without
much force or determination. On political subjects, his opinions were
not very sound.&rsquo; It is rather too much when a village-preacher writes in
this strain of the greatest man his country has ever produced.</p></div>

we consider the variety of talents displayed by this man; as a public
speaker, a man of business, a wit, a courtier, a companion, an author, a
philosopher; he is justly the object of great admiration. If we consider
him merely as an author and philosopher, the light in which we view him
at present, though very estimable, <i>he was yet inferior to his
contemporary Galileo, perhaps even to Kepler</i>.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The national spirit
which prevails among the English, and which forms their great happiness,

language of their collectors is sometimes ambiguous; so that, by the
same return, one statistician may mean one thing, and another
statistician may mean something quite different. This is well
exemplified in medical statistics; whence several writers, unacquainted
with the philosophy of scientific proof, have supposed that medicine is
incapable of mathematical treatment. In point of fact, however, the only
real impediment is the shameful state of clinical and pathological
terminology, which is in such confusion as to throw doubt upon all

to reside with his mother at his native town of Kirkaldy, and remained
there for ten years. All the attempts of his friends in Edinburgh to
draw him thither were vain; and from a kind and lively letter of Mr.
Hume upon the subject, complaining that, though within sight of him on
the opposite side of the Frith of Forth, he could not have speech of
him, it appears that no one was aware of the occupations in which those
years were passed.&rsquo; <i>Brougham's Life of Adam Smith</i>, p. 189.

the world, or for the business of active life. The comprehensive
speculations with which he had been occupied from his youth, and the

common occurrences; and he frequently exhibited instances of absence,
which have scarcely been surpassed by the fancy of La Bruyère.&rsquo;

to me, of ability not quite equal to his repute, has stated very clearly
and accurately this favourite method of his countrymen. &lsquo;In examining
the history of mankind, as well as in examining the phenomena of the
material world, when we cannot trace the process by which an event <i>has
been</i> produced, it is often of importance to be able to show how it <i>may
have been</i> produced by natural causes.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;To this species of
philosophical investigation, which has no appropriated name in our
language, I shall take the liberty of giving the title of <i>Theoretical</i>
or <i>Conjectural History</i>; an expression which coincides pretty nearly in
its meaning with that of <i>Natural History</i> as employed by Mr. Hume, and
with what some French writers have called Histoire Raisonnée.&rsquo; <i>Dugald
Stewart's Biographical Memoirs</i>, pp. 48, 49. Hence (p. 53), &lsquo;in most
cases, it is of more importance to ascertain the progress that is most
simple, than the progress that is most agreeable to fact; for,
paradoxical as the proposition may appear, it is certainly true, that
<i>the real progress is not always the most natural</i>. It may have been
determined by particular accidents, which are not likely again to occur,
and which cannot be considered as forming any part of that general
provision which nature has made for the improvement of the race.&rsquo;</p></div>

Human Nature</i>, book iii. part ii. &lsquo;This, however, hinders not but that
philosophers may, if they please, extend their reasoning to the supposed
<i>state of nature</i>; provided they allow it to be a mere philosophical
fiction, which never had, and never could have, any reality.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The
same liberty may be permitted to moral, which is allowed to natural
philosophers; and &rsquo;tis very usual with the latter to consider any motion
as compounded and consisting of two parts separate from each other,
though, at the same time, they acknowledge it to be in itself
uncompounded and inseparable.&rsquo; <i>Philosophical Works</i>, vol. ii. p. 263.</p></div>

false,&rsquo; could &lsquo;never be distinctly conceived by the mind.&rsquo;

for success in our philosophical researches, <i>to leave the tedious,
lingering method</i>, which we have hitherto followed, and instead of
taking now and then a castle or a village on the frontier, to march up
directly to the capital, or centre of these sciences, to human nature
itself; which, being once masters of, we may every where else hope for
an easy victory. From this station we may extend our conquests over all
those sciences which more immediately concern human life, and may
afterwards proceed, at leisure, to discover more fully those which are
the objects of pure curiosity.&rsquo; <i>Hume's Philosophical Works</i>, vol. i. p.
8. See also, in vol. ii. pp. 73, 74, his remarks on the way &lsquo;to consider

as this of power is; but wherever we reason, we must antecedently be
possessed of clear ideas, which may be the objects of our reasoning.&rsquo;
<i>Hume's Philosophical Works</i>, vol. i. p. 217. Compare vol. ii. p. 276,
on our arriving at a knowledge of causes &lsquo;by a kind of taste or fancy.&rsquo;
Hence, the larger view preceding the smaller, and being essentially
independent of it, will constantly contradict it; and he complains, for
instance, that &lsquo;difficulties, which seem unsurmountable in theory, are
easily got over in practice.&rsquo; vol. ii. p. 357; and again, in vol. iii.
p. 326, on the effort needed to &lsquo;reconcile reason to experience.&rsquo; But,
after all, it is rather by a careful study of his works, than by quoting
particular passages, that his method can be understood. In the two
sentences, however, just cited, the reader will see that theory and
reason represent the larger view; while practice and experience
represent the smaller.</p></div>

has no leisure to admire the regular face of nature, or make inquiries
concerning the cause of those objects to which, from his infancy, he has
been gradually accustomed. On the contrary, the more regular and
uniform, that is the more perfect, nature appears, the more is he
familiarized to it, and the less inclined to scrutinize and examine it.
A monstrous birth excites his curiosity, and is deemed a prodigy. It
alarms him from its novelty, and immediately sets him a trembling, and
sacrificing, and praying. But an animal complete in all its limbs and
organs is to him an ordinary spectacle, and produces no religious
opinion or affection. Ask him whence that animal arose? He will tell
you, from the copulation of its parents. And these, whence? From the
copulation of theirs. A few removes satisfy his curiosity, and set the
objects at such a distance that he entirely loses sight of them. Imagine
not that he will so much as start the question, whence the first animal,
much less whence the whole system, or united fabric of the universe
arose. Or, if you start such a question to him, expect not that he will
employ his mind with any anxiety about a subject so remote, so

some grovelling and familiar notion of superior powers, before they
stretch their conception to that perfect Being who bestowed order on the
whole frame of nature. <i>We may as reasonably imagine, that men inhabited
palaces before huts and cottages</i>, or studied geometry before
agriculture, as assert that the Deity appeared to them a pure spirit,
omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, before he was apprehended to be
a powerful though limited being, with human passions and appetites,
limbs and organs. The mind rises gradually from inferior to superior. By
abstracting from what is imperfect, it forms an idea of perfection; and
slowly distinguishing the nobler parts of its own frame from the
grosser, it learns to transform only the former, much elevated and
refined, to its divinity. Nothing could disturb this <i>natural progress
of thought</i>, but some obvious and invincible argument, which might
immediately lead the mind into the pure principles of theism, and make
it overleap, at one bound, the vast interval which is interposed between
the human and the Divine nature. But though I allow, that the order and
frame of the universe, when accurately examined, affords such an
argument, yet <i>I can never think</i> that this consideration could have an
influence on mankind, when they formed their first rude notions of
religion.&rsquo; <i>Natural History of Religion</i>, in <i>Philosophical Works</i>, vol.

given of the loose manner in which he took for granted that certain
phenomena were ultimate, in order that, instead of analyzing them, he
might reason from them. &lsquo;Dr. Reid has no hesitation in classing the
voluntary command of our organs, that is, the sequence of feeling and
action implied in all acts of will, among instincts. The power of
lifting a morsel of food to the mouth, is, according to him, an
instinctive or pre-established conjunction of the wish and the deed;
that is to say, the emotional state of hunger, coupled with the sight of
a piece of bread, is associated, through a primitive link of the mental
constitution, with the several movements of the hand, arm, and mouth,
concerned in the act of eating. <i>This assertion of Dr. Reid's may be
simply met by appealing to the facts.</i> It is not true that human beings
possess, at birth, any voluntary command of their limbs whatsoever. A
babe of two months old cannot use its hands in obedience to its desires.
The infant can grasp nothing, hold nothing, can scarcely fix its eyes on
anything.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;If the more perfect command of our voluntary movements
implied in every art be an acquisition, so is the less perfect command
of these movements that grows upon a child during the first year of
life.&rsquo; <i>Bain on the Senses and the Intellect</i>, London, 1855, pp. 292,

applied to the law of gravitation by Professor Faraday, in his
<i>Discourse on the Conservation of Force</i>, 1857; an essay full of thought
and power, and which should be carefully studied by every one who wishes
to understand the direction which the highest speculations of physical
science are now taking. I will quote only one passage from the opening,
to give the reader an idea of its general scope, irrespective of the
more special question of gravitation. &lsquo;The progress of the strict
science of modern times has tended more and more to produce the
conviction that force can neither be created nor destroyed; and to
render daily more manifest the value of the knowledge of that truth in
experimental research.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Agreeing with those who admit the
conservation of force to be a principle in physics, as large and sure as
that of the indestructibility of matter, or the invariability of
gravity, I think that no particular idea of force has a right to
unlimited or unqualified acceptance, that does not include assent to
it.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_757_757" id="Footnote_757_757"></a><a href="#FNanchor_757_757"><span class="label">[757]</span></a> As an illustration of this doctrine, I cannot do better
than quote the following passage from one of the most suggestive and
clearly reasoned books which has been written in this century by an
English physicist: &lsquo;Wave your hand; the motion which has apparently
ceased, is taken up by the air, from the air by the walls of the room,
&amp;c., and so by direct and reacting waves, continually comminuted, but
never destroyed. It is true that, at a certain point, we lose all means
of detecting the motion, from its minute subdivision, which defies our
most delicate means of appreciation, but we can indefinitely extend our
power of detecting it accordingly as we confine its direction, or
increase the delicacy of our examination. Thus, if the hand be moved in
unconfined air, the motion of the air would not be sensible to a person
at a few feet distant; but if a piston of the same extent of surface as
the hand be moved with the same rapidity in a tube, the blast of air may
be distinctly felt at several yards' distance. There is no greater
absolute amount of motion in the air in the second than in the first
case, but its direction is restrained, so as to make its means of
detection more facile. By carrying on this restraint, as in the air-gun,
we get a power of detecting the motion, and of moving other bodies at
far greater distances. The puff of air which would in the air-gun
project a bullet a quarter of a mile, if allowed to escape without its
direction being restrained, as by the bursting of a bladder, would not
be perceptible at a yard's distance, though the same absolute amount of
motion be impressed on the surrounding air.&rsquo; <i>Grove's Correlation of
Physical Forces</i>, London, 1855, pp. 24, 25. In a work now issuing from
the press, and still unfinished, it is suggested, with considerable
plausibility, that Persistence of Force would be a more accurate
expression than Conservation of Force. See Mr. Herbert Spencer's <i>First
Principles</i>, London, 1861, p. 251. The title of this book gives an
inadequate notion of the importance of the subjects with which it deals,
and of the reach and subtlety of thought which characterize it. Though
some of the generalizations appear to me rather premature, no
well-instructed and disciplined intellect can consider them without
admiration of the remarkable powers displayed by their author.</p></div>

The experience of more than a century had made us consider the
thermometer as a sure and accurate indicator of heat, and of all its
variations. We had learned to distrust all others. Yet, in the
liquefaction and vaporization of bodies, we had proofs uncontrovertible
of the entrance of heat into the bodies. And we could, by suitable
processes, get it out of them again. Dr. Black said that it was
concealed in them,&mdash;<i>latent</i>,&mdash;it was as much
concealed as carbonic acid is in marble, or water in zeolite,&mdash;it was
concealed till Dr. Black detected it. He called it Latent Heat. He did
not mean by this term that it was a different kind of heat from the heat
which expanded bodies, but merely that it was concealed from our sense
of heat, and from the thermometer.&rsquo; See also p. xxxvii.: &lsquo;Philosophers
had long been accustomed to consider the thermometer as the surest means
for detecting the presence of heat or fire in bodies, and they
distrusted all others.&rsquo;</p></div>

doctrine in his lectures in 1761, before he had made a single experiment
on the subject.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The requisite experiments were first attempted by
Dr. Black in 1764.&rsquo; <i>Thomson's History of Chemistry</i>, vol. i. p. 324.
See also pp. 319, 320; and on the history of the idea in Black's mind as
early as the year 1754, see the interesting extracts from his note-books
in Robison's appendix to <i>Black's Lectures</i>, vol. i pp. 525, 526.</p>

<p>The statement of Dr. Thomson refers to the completion, or last stage, of
the discovery, namely the vaporific combination of heat. But from a
letter which Black wrote to Watt in 1780 (<i>Muirhead's Life of Watt</i>,
London, 1859, p. 303), it appears that Thomson has even understated the
question, and that Black, instead of first teaching his theory in 1761,
taught it three years earlier, that is, <i>six</i> years before the decisive
experiments were made. &lsquo;I began,&rsquo; writes Black, &lsquo;to give the doctrine of
latent heat in my lectures at Glasgow in the winter 1757&ndash;58, which, I
believe, was the first winter of my lecturing there; or if I did not
give it that winter, I certainly gave it in the 1758&ndash;59; and I have
delivered it every year since that time in my winter lectures, which I
continued to give at Glasgow until winter 1766&ndash;67, when I began to
lecture in Edinburgh.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_762_762" id="Footnote_762_762"></a><a href="#FNanchor_762_762"><span class="label">[762]</span></a> And he distinctly states that, even in other matters,
when he did make experiments, their object was to confirm theory, and
not to suggest it. Thus, to give one of many instances, in his
<i>Lectures</i>, vol. i. p. 354, he says, respecting salts, &lsquo;When we examine
the solidity of this reasoning by an experiment, <i>we have the pleasure
to find facts agree exactly with the theory</i>.&rsquo;</p></div>

Chemistry</i>, vol. i. p. 118. Contrasting his theory of heat with that
previously received, he says, &lsquo;But, were the ice and snow to melt as
suddenly as they must necessarily do, were the former opinion of the
action of heat in melting them well founded, the torrents and
inundations would be incomparably more irresistible and dreadful. They
would tear up and sweep away every thing, and that so suddenly, that
mankind should have great difficulty to escape from their ravages.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_764_764" id="Footnote_764_764"></a><a href="#FNanchor_764_764"><span class="label">[764]</span></a> &lsquo;Dr. Black quickly perceived the vast importance of this
discovery; and took a pleasure in laying before his students a view of
the extensive and beneficial effects of this habitude of heat in the
economy of nature. He made them remark how, by this means, there was
accumulated, during the summer season, a vast magazine of heat, which,
by gradually emerging, during congelation, from the water which covers
the face of the earth, serves to temper the deadly cold of winter. Were
it not for this quantity of heat, amounting to 145 degrees, which
emerges from every particle of water as it freezes, and which diffuses
itself through the atmosphere, the sun would no sooner go a few degrees
to the south of the equator, than we should feel all the horrors of
winter.&rsquo; <i>Robison's Preface to Black's Lectures</i>, vol. i. p. xxxviii.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_765_765" id="Footnote_765_765"></a><a href="#FNanchor_765_765"><span class="label">[765]</span></a> As I am writing an account of Black's views, and not a
criticism of them, I shall give them, without comment, in his own words,
and in the words of one of his pupils. &lsquo;Here we can also trace another
magnificent train of changes, which are nicely accommodated to the wants
of the inhabitants of this globe. In the equatorial regions, the
oppressive heat of the sun is prevented from a destructive accumulation
by copious evaporation. The waters, stored with their vaporific heat,
are thus carried aloft into the atmosphere, till the rarest of the
vapour reaches the very cold regions of the air, which immediately forms
a small portion of it into a fleecy cloud. This also further tempers the
scorching heat by its opacity, performing the acceptable office of a
screen. From thence the clouds are carried to the inland countries, to
form the sources in the mountains, which are to supply the numberless
streams that water the fields. And, by the steady operation of causes,
which are tolerably uniform, the greater part of the vapours pass on to
the circumpolar regions, there to descend in rains and dews; and in this
beneficent conversion into rain, by the cold of those regions, each
particle of steam gives up the 700 or 800 degrees of heat which were
latent in it. These are immediately diffused, and soften the rigour of
those less comfortable climates.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;I am persuaded that the heat
absorbed in spontaneous evaporation greatly contributes to enable
animals to bear the heat of the tropical climates, where the thermometer
frequently continues to show the temperature of the human body. Such
heats, indeed, are barely supportable, and enervate the animal, making
it lazy and indolent, indulging in the most relaxed postures, and
avoiding every exertion of body or mind. The inhabitants are induced to
drink large draughts of diluting liquors, which transude through their
pores most copiously, carrying off with them a vast deal of this
troublesome and exhausting heat. There is in the body itself a continual
laboratory, or manufacture of heat, and, were the surrounding air of
such a temperature as not to carry it off, it would soon accumulate so
as to destroy life. The excessive perspiration, supplied by diluting
draughts, performs the same office as the cold air without the tropics,
in guarding us from this fatal accumulation.&rsquo; <i>Black's Lectures</i>, vol.
i. pp. xlvi. 214.</p></div>

cherishes and enlivens this globe, allowed to increase beyond the bounds
at present prescribed to it; beside the destruction of all animal and

the water would lose its present form, and assume that of an elastic
vapour like air; the solid parts of the globe would be melted and
confounded together, or mixed with the air and water in smoke and
vapour; and nature would return to the original chaos.&rsquo; <i>Black's

consider the heat that permeates all bodies, and unites with them in
various proportions, as merely the subtle fluid of light in a state of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_780_780" id="Footnote_780_780"></a><a href="#FNanchor_780_780"><span class="label">[780]</span></a> The supposition, that volcanic agencies were formerly
more potent than they are now, is by no means inconsistent with the
scientific doctrine of uniformity, though it is generally considered to
be so. It is one thing to assert the uniformity of natural laws; it is
quite another thing to assert the uniformity of natural causes. Heat may
once have produced far greater effects than it can do at present, and
yet the laws of nature be unchanged, and the order and sequence of
events unbroken. What I would venture to suggest to geologists is, that
they have not taken sufficiently into account the theory of the
interchange of forces, which seems to offer a solution of at least part
of the problem. For, by that theory, a large portion of the heat which
formerly existed may have been metamorphosed into other forces, such as
light, chemical affinity, and gravitation. The increase of these forces
consequent on the diminution of heat, would have facilitated the
consolidation of matter; and until such forces possessed a certain
energy, water, which afterwards became so prominent, could not have been
formed. If the power of chemical affinity, for instance, were much
weaker than it is, water would assuredly resolve itself into its
component gases. Without wishing to lay too much stress on this
speculation, I submit it to the consideration of competent judges,
because I am convinced that any hypothesis, not absolutely inconsistent
with the known laws of nature, is preferable to that dogma of
interference, which what may be called the miraculous school of
geologists wish to foist upon us, in utter ignorance of its
incompatibility with the conclusions of the most advanced minds in other
departments of thought.</p>

<p>The remarks in Sir Roderick Murchison's great work (<i>Siluria</i>, London,
1854, pp. 475, 476) on the &lsquo;grander intensity of former causation,&rsquo; and
on the difficulty this opposes to the &lsquo;uniformitarians,&rsquo; apply merely to
those who take for granted that <i>each</i> force has always been equally
powerful: they do not affect those who suppose that it is only the
<i>aggregate</i> of force which remains unimpaired. Though the distribution
of forces may be altered, their gross amount is not susceptible of
change, so far as the highest conceptions of our actual science extend.
Consequently, there is no need for us to believe that, in different
periods, the intensity of causation varies; though we may believe that
some one agent, such as heat, had at one time more energy than it has
ever had since.</p></div>

divided into two principal classes, the aqueous and the igneous. To the
aqueous belong rain, rivers, torrents, springs, currents, and tides; to
the igneous, volcanos and earthquakes. Both these classes are
instruments of decay as well as of reproduction; but they may also be
regarded as antagonist forces. For the aqueous agents are incessantly
labouring to reduce the inequalities of the earth's surface to a level;
while the igneous are equally active in restoring the unevenness of the
external crust, partly by heaping up new matter in certain localities,

the history of thermotics, considered purely as a science, and apart
from practical application. Mr. Muirhead, in his interesting work which
I have just quoted, has published (pp. 484&ndash;486) some remarks made on the
subject by Watt, several years after the death of Black, which, though
perfectly fair and candid, show that Watt had a rather confused notion
of the real difference between an invention and a discovery.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_807_807" id="Footnote_807_807"></a><a href="#FNanchor_807_807"><span class="label">[807]</span></a> Mr. Muirhead, in his <i>Life of Watt</i>, pp. 301&ndash;370, seems
to have put the priority of Watt beyond further doubt; though he is
somewhat hard upon Cavendish, who, there can be little question, made
the discovery for himself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_808_808" id="Footnote_808_808"></a><a href="#FNanchor_808_808"><span class="label">[808]</span></a> I would not wish to diminish one jot of the veneration in
which the great name of Watt is justly held. But when I find the opinion
of Dr. Withering, the botanist, quoted, to the effect that his
&lsquo;abilities and acquirements placed him next, if not superior, to
Newton.&rsquo; (<i>Muirhead's Life of Watt</i>, p. 302), I cannot but protest against
such indiscriminate eulogy, which would rank Watt in the same class as
one of those godlike intellects of which the whole world has not
produced a score, and which are entitled to be termed inspired, if ever
human being was so. Another instance of this injudicious panegyric will
be found in the same otherwise excellent work (<i>Muirhead</i>, pp. 324,
325), where we read that Watt's discovery that water consists of oxygen
and hydrogen, was &lsquo;the commencement of a new era, the dawn of a new day
in physical inquiry, the real foundation of the new system of chemistry;
nay, even a discovery &ldquo;perhaps of greater importance than any single
fact which human ingenuity has ascertained either before or since.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_809_809" id="Footnote_809_809"></a><a href="#FNanchor_809_809"><span class="label">[809]</span></a> That there was no plagiarism on the part of Watt, we know
from positive evidence; that there was none on the part of Cavendish,
may be fairly presumed, both from the character of the man, and also
from the fact that in the then state of chemical knowledge the discovery
was imminent, and could not have been long delayed. It was antecedently
probable that the composition of water would be ascertained by different
persons at the same time, as we have seen in many other discoveries
which have been simultaneously made, when the human mind, in that
particular department of inquiry, had reached a certain point. We are
too apt to suspect philosophers of stealing from each other, what their
own abilities are sufficient to work out for themselves. It is, however,
certain that Watt thought himself ill-treated by Cavendish. See <i>Watt's
Correspondence on the Composition of Water</i>, London, 1846, pp. 48, 61.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_810_810" id="Footnote_810_810"></a><a href="#FNanchor_810_810"><span class="label">[810]</span></a> On 26th November 1783, he writes: &lsquo;For many years I have
entertained an opinion that air was a modification of water; which was
originally founded on the facts, that in most cases where air was
actually made, which should be distinguished from those wherein it is
only extricated from substances containing it in their pores, or
otherwise united to them in the state of air, the substances were such
as were known to contain water as one of their constituent parts, yet no
water was obtained in the processes, except what was known to be only
loosely connected with them, such as the water of the crystallization of
salts. <i>This opinion arose from a discovery that the latent heat
contained in steam diminished, in proportion as the sensible heat of the
water from which it was produced, increased</i>; or, in other words, that
the latent heat of steam was less when it was produced under a greater
pressure, or in a more dense state, and greater when it was produced
under a less pressure, or in a less dense state; which led me to
conclude, that when a very great degree of heat was necessary for the
production of the steam, the latent heat would be wholly changed into
sensible heat; and that, in such cases, the steam itself might suffer
some remarkable change. I now abandon this opinion, in so far as relates
to the change of water into air, as I think that may be accounted for on
better principles.&rsquo; See this remarkable passage, which is quite decisive
as to the real history of Watt's discovery, in <i>Correspondence of James
Watt on the Composition of Water</i>, London, 1846, pp. 84, 85. Compare p.
cxxiv. and p. 248 note.</p></div>

announcing his discovery, he, well knowing the empirical character of
the English mind, apologizes for this; and says, &lsquo;I feel much reluctance
to lay my thoughts on these subjects before the public in their present
indigested state, and <i>without having been able to bring them to the
test of such experiments as would confirm or refute them</i>.&rsquo; <i>Watt's

to confirm my theory</i> of water's undergoing some very remarkable change
at the point where all its latent heat would be changed into sensible
heat.&rsquo;</p></div>

consideration of latent heat; an omission which he even attempts to
justify, in one of the passages interpolated by Blagden. But it is well
known to every one acquainted with the first principles of chemical
science, even as it was taught in the days of Black, and it was
indisputably familiar to Mr. Watt, that no aëriform fluid can be
converted into a liquid, nor any liquid into a solid, without tho
evolution of heat, previously latent. This essential part of the
process, Mr. Cavendish's theory does not embrace; but without it, no
theory on the subject can be complete; and it will presently be seen,
that Mr. Watt took it fully into account.&rsquo; <i>Muirhead's Life of Watt</i>, p.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_818_818" id="Footnote_818_818"></a><a href="#FNanchor_818_818"><span class="label">[818]</span></a> I formerly adopted the commonly received division of
organic statics, and organic dynamics; the statics being anatomy, and
the dynamics being physiology. But, I now think that our knowledge is
not sufficiently advanced to make this so convenient as the division
into physiological and pathological, or into normal and abnormal,
provided we remember that in reality nothing is abnormal. The
practically useful, but eminently unscientific, doctrine, that there can
be alteration of function without alteration of structure, has effaced
some of the most essential distinctions between anatomy and physiology,
and especially between morbid anatomy and morbid physiology. Until those
distinctions are recognized, the scientific conceptions of professional
writers must be confused, however valuable their practical suggestions
may be. While men are capable of believing that it is <i>possible</i> for
variations of function to proceed from any cause except variations of
structure, the philosophic importance of anatomy will be imperfectly
appreciated, and its true relation to physiology will remain undefined.
Inasmuch, however, as, with our actual resources, the most careful
dissection is often unable to detect (in insanity, for instance) those
changes of structure which produce changes of function, superficial
thinkers are placed under a strong temptation to deny their invariable
connexion; and while the microscope is so imperfect, and chemistry so
backward, it is impossible that experiments should always convince them
of their mistake. Hence, I believe that until our means of empirical
research are greatly improved, all such investigations, notwithstanding
their immense value in other respects, will tend to lead mere inductive
minds into error, by making them rely too much on what they call the
facts of the case, to the prejudice of the reason. This is what I mean
by saying, that our knowledge is not sufficiently advanced to make it
advisable to divide the sciences of organic bodies into physiological
and anatomical. At present, and probably for some time yet, the humbler
division into physiological and pathological, may be deemed safer, and
more likely to produce solid results.</p></div>

science, although the limits of its domain have, no doubt, been
variously circumscribed or interpreted at different times. Of late
years, it has met with a new basis and support in morbid anatomy, which,
in the inadequacy of its discoveries in the solids to account for
disease and death, has been compelled to seek for an extension of its

system, but more particularly with regard to that of the Animal Power or
Energy of the brain, were incorporated with every opinion which he
taught concerning the phenomena of the animal economy, the causes of
diseases, and the operation of medicines; and they may be said to
constitute a most important part, if not the sole basis, of that system
of the Practice of Physic, which he made the subject of prelection, as
well as of study, for a period of nearly forty years, before he ventured
to give it to the public.&rsquo; I should mention, that Cullen, under the term

&lsquo;<i>Whether these distinctions be well or ill founded, it is not my
business to inquire.</i>&rsquo; But though he did not deem it his business to
inquire into the accuracy of these and similar distinctions, he thought
himself justified in assuming them, and reasoning from them as if they
could explain the working of those sensations, whose perversion formed
the point of contact between metaphysics and pathology. See, for
instance, in his <i>Works</i>, vol. i. p. 46, the long series of unproved and

most attractive peculiarities of his fine intellect, confesses his want
of acquaintance with the microscope: &lsquo;It leaves me, who am not
conversant in such observations, altogether uncertain with respect to
the precise nature of this part of the blood.&rsquo; <i>Cullen's Works</i>, vol. i.
p. 195. A pathologist without a microscope is an unarmed man, indeed. In
regard to his animal chemistry, one passage may be quoted as a specimen
of the manner in which he arrived at conclusions speculatively, instead
of subjecting the phenomena to experimental investigation. &lsquo;We may
remark it to be highly probable, that all animal matter is originally
formed of vegetable; because all animals either feed directly and
entirely on vegetables, or upon other animals that do so. From hence it
is probable, that all animal substances may be traced to a vegetable
origin; and <i>therefore</i>, if we would inquire into the production of
animal matter, we <i>must first inquire</i> in what manner vegetable matter
may be converted into animal?&rsquo; <i>Cullen's Works</i>, vol. i. pp. 177, 178.
The <i>therefore</i> and the <i>must</i>, resulting merely from an antecedent
probability, are characteristic of that over-boldness, into which
deduction is apt to degenerate, and which is strongly contrasted with
the opposite vice of over-timidity, by which inductive reasoners are
tainted.</p></div>

edit. London, 1857, vol. i. p. 41) says of the humoral pathology, that,
&lsquo;the absurdity of the hypothesis, and <i>still more the dangerous practice
which this doctrine generated</i>, began to be manifest, and led to its
total abandonment.&rsquo; But, with every respect for this eminent authority,
I venture to observe, that this supposition of Dr. Watson's is
contradicted by the whole history of the human mind. There is no
well-attested case on record of any theory having been abandoned,
because it produced dangerous results. As long as a theory is believed,
men will ascribe its evil consequences to any cause except the right
one. And a theory which is once established, will always be believed,
until there is some change in knowledge which shakes its foundation.
Every practical change may, by careful analysis, be shown to depend, in
the first instance, on some change of speculative opinions. Even at the
present day, many doctrines are generally held in the most civilized
countries, which are producing dangerous practical consequences, and
have produced those consequences for centuries. But the mischief which
the doctrine engenders does not weaken the doctrine itself. Nothing can
do that, but the general progress of knowledge, which, by altering
former opinions, modifies future conduct.</p></div>

deceived in this respect by his occasional use of the expression
&lsquo;nervous fluid,&rsquo; as if he were willing to let in the idea of humorism.
But, in one place, he distinctly guards himself against such
misconstruction. &lsquo;Now, to avoid determining any thing with regard to
these opinions, I have used the term of <i>nervous power</i>; but as this is
a little ambiguous, I choose to express it by <i>nervous fluid</i>; not that
I suppose, with Dr. Boerhaave, that the brain is an excretory, and that
a fluid is secreted from it: <i>I mean nothing more than that there is a
condition of the nerves which fits them for the communication of
motion</i>. But I defer the consideration of these opinions for the
present, and perhaps <i>ad Græcas calendas</i>; but nothing shall be rested
upon the nervous fluid, it shall be considered merely as <i>a power</i>
fitted for communicating motions.&rsquo; <i>Cullen's Works</i>, vol. i. p. 17.

(<i>Works</i>, vol. i. p. 129), might easily be misunderstood.</p></div>

debility of the animal motions, the imperfect sensations, the feeling of
cold, while the body is truly warm, and some other symptoms, all show
that the energy of the brain is, on this occasion, greatly weakened; and
I presume that, as the weakness of the action of the heart can hardly be
imputed to any other cause, this weakness also is a proof of the
diminished energy of the brain. So I conclude, that a debility of the
nervous power forms the beginning of the cold fit, and lays the

it is necessary to add here, that these remote causes of fever, human
and marsh effluvia, seem to be of a debilitating or sedative
quality.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Though we have endeavoured to show that fevers generally
arise from marsh or human effluvia, we cannot, with any certainty,
exclude some other remote causes, which are commonly supposed to have at
least a share in producing those diseases. And I proceed, therefore, to
inquire concerning these causes; the first of which that merits
attention, is the power of cold applied to the human body.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Besides
cold, there are other powers that seem to be remote causes of fever;
such as fear, intemperance in drinking, excess in venery, and other
circumstances, which evidently weaken the system. But whether any of
these sedative powers be alone the remote cause of fever, or if they
only operate either as concurring with the operation of marsh or human
effluvia, or as giving an opportunity to the operation of cold, are
questions not to be positively answered.&rsquo; <i>Practice of Physic</i>, in
<i>Cullen's Works</i>, vol. i. pp. 546, 552. One part of this view has been
corroborated, since the time of Cullen. &lsquo;The experiments of Chossat and
others clearly prove cold to be a direct sedative.&rsquo; <i>Williams'
Principles of Medicine</i>, 2nd edit. London, 1848, p. 11. Compare
<i>Watson's Principles and Practice of Physic</i>, 4th edit. London, 1857,

sleep caused by exposure to severe or long-continued cold.&rsquo; <i>Erichsen's
Surgery</i>, 2nd edit. London, 1857, p. 336; but as to this, Dr. Watson
(<i>Principles of Physic</i>, vol. i. p. 89) is sceptical, and thinks that,
in those cases which are recorded, the drowsiness ascribed to cold, is,
in a great measure, the result of fatigue.</p></div>

animal economy, that this debility proves an indirect stimulus to the
sanguiferous system; whence, by the intervention of the cold stage and
spasm connected with it, the action of the heart and larger arteries is
increased, and continues so till it has had the effect of restoring the
energy of the brain, of extending this energy to the extreme vessels, of
restoring, therefore, their action, and thereby especially overcoming
the spasm affecting them; upon the removing of which, the excretion of
sweat, and other marks of the relaxation of excretories, take place.&rsquo;
<i>Practice of Physic</i>, in <i>Cullen's Works</i>, vol. i. pp. 501, 502. See
also p. 636, § cciii. Or, as he elsewhere expresses himself (vol. i. p.
561): &lsquo;With regard to the event of fevers, this is the fundamental
principle: <i>in fevers, nature cures the disease</i>; that is, certain
motions tending to death continue the disease, but, in consequence of
the laws of the animal economy, other motions are excited by these which
have a tendency to remove it.&rsquo;</p></div>

proximate cause, it follows, most naturally, from the view there given,
that the continued fever is always owing to an excess of spasm, or to an
excess of debility: as the one or other of these prevails, it will give
one or other of the two forms, either the Synocha or inflammatory fever,

Brunonian system, which was founded by Dr. John Brown, who was first the
pupil of Cullen, and afterwards his rival. But a careful perusal of his
works has convinced me that the real basis of his doctrine, or the point
from which he started, was not pathology, but therapeutics. His hasty
division of all diseases into sthenic and asthenic, has no claim to be
deemed a scientific generalization, but was a mere artificial
arrangement, resulting from a desire to substitute a stimulating
treatment in the place of the old lowering one. He, no doubt, went to
the opposite extreme; but that being a purely practical subject, this
Introduction has no concern with it. For the same reason, I omit all
mention of Currie, who, though an eminent therapeutician, was a
commonplace pathologist. That so poor and thinly-peopled a country as
Scotland, should, in so short a period, have produced so many remarkable
men, is extremely curious.</p></div>

writings we occasionally find an obscurity in the expression of his
thoughts, a want of logical accuracy in his reasonings, and an
incorrectness in his language, resulting from a deficient education.&rsquo;
But, a deficient education will never make a man obscure. Neither will a
good education make him lucid. The only cause of clearness of expression
is clearness of thought; and clearness of thought is a natural gift,
which the most finished and systematic culture can but slightly improve.
Uneducated men, without a thousandth part of John Hunter's intellect,
are often clear enough. On the other hand, it as frequently happens that
men, who have received an excellent education, cannot speak or write ten
consecutive sentences which do not contain some troublesome ambiguity.
In Hunter's works such ambiguities are abundant; and this is probably
one of the reasons why no one has yet given a connected view of his
philosophy. On his obscurity, compare <i>Cooper's Life of Sir Astley
Cooper</i>, London, 1843, vol. i. pp. 151, 152; <i>Paget's Lectures on

d'après Bâcon, n'avaient hérité de lui qu'une répugnance invincible pour
les hypothèses et les systèmes, une grande vénération pour l'expérience,
et un désir extrême de multiplier le nombre des observations. Ce fut
chez les Anglais que la méthode empirique en médecine trouva le plus de
partisans, et c'est principalement aussi chez eux qu'elle s'est répandue
jusqu'aux temps les plus rapprochés de nous. Sa propagation y fut
favorisée, non-seulement par le profond respect que les Anglais
continuent toujours de porter à l'immortel chancelier, mais encore par
la haute importance que la nation entière attache au sens commun,
<i>common sense</i>, et elle y demeura l'ennemie irréconciliable de tous les

be doubted, and the strangest functions to be attributed to it. Hunter,
however, who was prepared to appreciate the true state of the
circulating system in insects, by his discovery of the approximately

different constituents of the blood, by the philosophical and most
difficult inquiry into their respective periods of formation in the
development of the embryo, Hunter made the interesting discovery that
the vessels of the embryo of a red-blooded animal circulated in the
first instance colourless blood, as in the invertebrate animals. &lsquo;The
red globules,&rsquo; he observes, &lsquo;seemed to be formed later in life than the
other two constituents, for we see while the chick is in the egg the
heart beating, and it then contains a transparent fluid before any red
globules are formed, which fluid we may suppose to be the serum and the
lymph.&rsquo; I well remember the feelings of surprise with which I listened,
while at Paris in 1832, to a memoir read before the Academy of Science,
by MM. Delpech and Coste, the object of which was the announcement of
the same fact as a novel and important discovery. The statement of the
French observers was received with all the consideration which its
importance justly merited, without its being suspected that our great
physiologist had, half a century before, embraced it, with all its
legitimate deductions, in the extended circle of his investigations.&rsquo;

by Mr. Gulliver, which, from his great general accuracy, there seems no
reason to question, the fact that the pale blood precedes the red, was
known even in the time of Glisson. See Gulliver's learned edition of
<i>Hewson's Works</i>, London, 1846, p. 222. But, to the contemporaries of
Glisson, such a fact was isolated, and consequently useless. Nothing is

their utility in the machine, the red globules certainly are not of such
universal use as the coagulating lymph, since they are not to be found
in all animals, <i>nor so early in those that have them</i>; nor are they
pushed into the extreme arteries, where we must suppose the coagulating
lymph reaches; neither do they appear to be so readily formed. This
being the case, <i>we must conclude them not to be the important part of
the blood in contributing to growth, repair, &amp;c. Their use would seem to
be connected with strength.</i>&rsquo; <i>A Treatise on the Blood, Inflammation,

Subsequent experiments have confirmed this. &lsquo;The proportion of red
globules <i>dried</i> to 1000 parts of blood, is in healthy males estimated
at 127 parts by Andral and Gavarret; lower and higher figures have been
given by other analysts, but this probably is the result of somewhat
different modes of proceeding. <i>In females the proportion of globules is
lower.</i> Becquerel and Rodier make the difference to be about 15 parts

<p>Another, and still more remarkable proof of the extent to which Hunter
outstripped his own age, appears in the following passage, which has
just been published in his posthumous works, and in which he anticipates
the grandest and most suggestive of all the ideas belonging to the
physiology of the nineteenth century. &lsquo;If we were capable of following
the progress of increase of the number of the parts of the most perfect
animal, as they first formed in succession, from the very first to its
state of full perfection, we should probably be able to compare it with
some one of the incomplete animals themselves, of every order of animals
in the Creation, being at no stage different from some of the inferior
orders. Or, in other words, if we were to take a series of animals, from
the more imperfect to the perfect, we should probably find an imperfect
animal, corresponding with some stage of the most perfect.&rsquo; <i>Essays and

place both in animals and vegetables, and may be divided into three
kinds. The first kind of action, or self-motion, is employed simply in
the economical operations, by which means the immediate functions are
carried on, and the necessary operations performed, with the materials
the animal or vegetable is in possession of, such as growth, support,
secretion, &amp;c. The blood is disposed of by the actions of the vessels,
according to their specific stimulus, producing all the above effects.
The juices of a plant are disposed of according to the different actions
of the sap-vessels, arising also from their specific stimulus, which is
different from that of blood-vessels, but equally produces growth; but a
vine will grow twenty feet in one summer, while a whale, probably, does
not grow so much in as many years.&rsquo; <i>Croonian Lectures on Muscular
Motion</i>, in <i>Hunter's Works</i>, vol. iv. p. 199.</p></div>

influence, and arises from a compound of internal and external stimulus;
it is excited by the state of the animal or vegetable, which gives the
stimulus of want, and being completed by external stimulus, produces the
proper supplies of nourishment. It produces motions of whole parts: thus
we see the <i>Hedysarum gyrans</i> moving its lesser foliola. This is an
action apparently similar to breathing in animals, though, perhaps, it
does not answer the same purpose; yet there is an alternate motion in
both.&rsquo; <i>Croonian Lectures</i>, in <i>Hunter's Works</i>, vol. iv. p. 200.</p></div>

consists principally of the motion of whole parts, which is not
inconsiderable in vegetables, as in the <i>Dionæa muscipula</i> and <i>Mimosa
pudica</i> is very evident.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;These actions are similar to what arise in
many animals from external stimulus.&rsquo; <i>Ibid.</i> vol. iv. p. 201.</p></div>

probably the same, and it is probably the same in all animals; but how
far they are the same in both classes, has not yet been determined. But
I think it will appear, in the investigation of this subject, that
vegetables and animals have actions evidently common to both, and that
the causes of these actions are apparently the same in both; and most
probably there is not an action in the vegetable, which does not
correspond or belong to the animal, although the mode of action in the
parts may not be the same, or muscular, in both.&rsquo; <i>Croonian Lectures</i>,

purposes are answered by them.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;The first kind of action appears to
be stronger in its power, although less in quantity, in vegetables than
in animals; for a small vine was capable of sustaining, and even of
raising, a column of sap 43 feet high, while a horse's heart was only
capable of supporting a column of blood 8 feet 9 inches high; both of
which columns must have been supported by the action of the internal
parts, for we must suppose the heart equal, or nearly so, to the
strength or action of the other parts of the vascular system; and when
we consider that the sap of the tallest tree must be supported, and even
raised from the root to the most distant branches, it must appear that
the power of such vegetables far exceeds the power of any animal, and,
indeed, it is such as the texture of a vegetable only can support. The
power of supporting a leaf erect for a whole day is as great an effort
of action as that of the elevator palpebrarum muscle of the eye of an
animal.&rsquo; <i>Hunter's Works</i>, vol. iv. pp. 203, 204. See also <i>Hunter's
Essays</i>, vol. i. p. 342: &lsquo;It is probable that the vegetable which can
the least bear a suspension of its actions, can do so more than the
animal which can bear it longest.&rsquo;</p></div>

in whom the principles may be more distinct and less blended with
others, or where the parts are differently constructed, in order to
show, from many varieties of structure, and from many different
considerations, what are the uses of the same parts in man; or, at
least, to show that they are not for the uses which have been commonly
assigned to them; and, as man is the most complicated part of the whole
animal creation, it will be proper, in the first place, to point out
general principles, common to all this species of matter, that I may be
better understood when I come to the more complicated machine, namely,
the human.&rsquo;</p></div>

how far they are of use or subservient to their actions.&rsquo; <i>Hunter's

of his desire to establish a connexion between animal and vegetable

(vol. i. pp. 345, 346); and on the theory of inflammation exhibited in
an oak-leaf (vol. i. p. 391). But even now, too little is known of the
diseases of the vegetable world to enable their study to be incorporated
with the science of the diseases of the animal world; and, in the time
of Hunter, the attempt was still less promising. Still, the effort shows
the grandeur and range of the man's mind; and though little was
effected, the method was right. So, too, in one of his essays on the
<i>Power of Producing Heat</i>, he says, &lsquo;In the course of a variety of
experiments on animals and vegetables, I have frequently observed that
the result of experiments in the one has explained the economy of the
other, and pointed out some principle common to both.&rsquo; <i>Hunter's Works</i>,

the different parts peculiar to each species of animal, as also in the
situation, formation, and construction of such parts, we call every
thing that deviates from that uniformity a &ldquo;monster,&rdquo; whether (it occur
in) crystallization, vegetation, or animalization. There must be some
principle for those deviations from the regular course of nature, in the
economy of such species as they occur in. In the present inquiry it is
the animal creation I mean to consider. Yet, as there may be in some
degree an analogy between all the three (kingdoms of nature), I shall
consider the other two, so far as this analogy seems to take place.&rsquo; &hellip;
&lsquo;Monsters are not peculiar to animals: they are less so in them,
perhaps, than in any species of matter. The vegetable (kingdom) abounds
with monsters; and perhaps the uncommon formation of many crystals may
be brought within the same species of production, and accounted for upon
the same principle, viz. some influence interfering with the established
law of regular formation. Monsters in crystals may arise from the same
cause, as mentioned in the &ldquo;Introduction;&rdquo; viz. either a wrong
arrangement of the parts of which the crystal is to be composed, or a
defect in the formation, from the first setting out being wrong, and
(the formation) going on in the same (wrong) line. The principle of
crystallization is in the solution; yet it requires more to set it
agoing, or into action, such, <i>e.g.</i>, as a solid surface. The
deficiency in the production of a true crystal may be in the solution
itself; or, I can conceive, that a very slight circumstance might alter
the form of a crystal, and even give the disposition for one (crystal)
to form upon another. Quickness in the progress of crystallization
produces irregularity and diminution in size.&rsquo; <i>Hunter's Essays</i>,
London, 1861, vol. i. pp. 239&ndash;241. The reader must remember, that, when
these remarks were written, the phenomena of crystallization had not
been subjected to that exact mathematical treatment which subsequently
revealed so many of their laws. Indeed, the goniometer was then so
coarse an instrument, that it was impossible to measure the angles of
crystals with accuracy.</p></div>

operations of the body are similar in this respect to actions or motions
in common matter. <i>It naturally results from this principle</i>, that no
two different fevers can exist in the same constitution, nor two local
diseases in the same part, at the same time. There are many local
diseases which have dispositions totally different, but having very
similar appearances, have been supposed by some to be one sort of
disease, by others to be a different kind, and by others again a
compound of two diseases.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;These, therefore, are often supposed to
be mixed, and to exist in the same part. Thus we hear of a pocky-scurvy,
a pocky-itch, rheumatic-gout, &amp;c. &amp;c., which names, <i>according to my

than his successors.&rsquo;</p></div>

has of late years attracted the attention of many distinguished
Continental and British pathologists.&rsquo; <i>Erichsen's Surgery</i>, London,
1857, p. 475. &lsquo;No subject more amply illustrates the essential services
which the science and art of medicine have derived from pathological
anatomy than that of phlebitis. By this study many a dark point in the
phenomena of disease has been either thoroughly elucidated, or, at all
events, rendered more comprehensible. We need only refer to the
so-termed malignant intermittents, consequent upon wounds and surgical
operations,&mdash;to certain typhoid conditions, puerperal diseases, and the
like, John Hunter, the elder Meckel, and Peter Frank, were the first to
commence the investigation.&rsquo; <i>Hasse's Anatomical Description of the
Diseases of the Organs of Circulation and Respiration</i>, London, 1846, p.
10. &lsquo;Hunter was the first to open the way, and since that period the
scalpel has shown that many previously unintelligible malignant
conditions are attributable to phlebitis.&rsquo; <i>Jones and Sieveking's
Pathological Anatomy</i>, London, 1854, p. 362. On the application of this
discovery to the theory of inflammation of the spleen, see <i>Rokitansky's
Pathological Anatomy</i>, vol. ii. p. 173, London, 1849; compare vol. iv.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_907_907" id="Footnote_907_907"></a><a href="#FNanchor_907_907"><span class="label">[907]</span></a> Sir Benjamin Brodie says: &lsquo;It is true that the essential
parts of John Hunter's doctrines as to inflammation and its consequences
are now so incorporated with what is taught in the schools, that to be
acquainted with them you need not seek them in his works; but I
recommend you, nevertheless, to make these your especial study, for the
sake of the other valuable information which they contain, and the
important views in physiology and pathology which, in almost every page,
are offered to your contemplation.&rsquo; <i>Brodie's Lectures on Pathology and
Surgery</i>, London, 1846, p. 25. &lsquo;John Hunter, whose treatise on
Inflammation is a mine in which all succeeding writers have dug.&rsquo;
<i>Watson's Principles and Practice of Physic</i>, London, 1857, vol. i. p.
146. &lsquo;The appeal to philosophical principles in Hunter's works was,
indeed, the cause of their being a closed volume to his less enlightened
contemporaries; but, though the principles implied or expressed,
subjected them to the scorn and neglect of those less imbued with the
spirit of philosophy, the results of those principles, verified as they
were by facts, have gradually and insensibly forced themselves on the
conviction of the profession; and though adopted silently, and without
acknowledgment, as if the authors themselves had forgotten or were
ignorant from whence they were derived, they now form the very
groundwork of all books, treatises, and lectures on professional
subjects.&rsquo; <i>Green's Vital Dynamics</i>, London, 1840, p. 81. Finally, I
will quote the very recent testimony of Mr. Simon, who, in his masterly,
and singularly beautiful, essay on Inflammation, has not only brought
together nearly every thing which is known on that interesting subject,
but has shown himself to be possessed of powers of generalization rare
in the medical profession, or, indeed, in any other profession. &lsquo;Without
undue partiality, an Englishman may be glad to say that the special
study of Inflammation dates from the labours of John Hunter. An
indefatigable observer of nature, untrammelled by educational forms, and
thoroughly a sceptic in his method of study, this large-minded surgeon
of ours went to work at inflammation with a full estimate of the
physiological vastness of his subject. He saw that, in order to
understand inflammation, he must regard it, not as one solitary fact of
disease, but in connexion with kindred phenomena&mdash;some of them truly
morbid in their nature, but many of them within the limits of health. He
saw that, for any one who would explain inflammation, all inequalities
of blood supply, all periodicities of growth, all actions of sympathy,
were part of the problem to be solved.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;He cannot be understood
without more reflection than average readers will give; and only they
who are content to struggle through a veil of obscure language, up to
the very reality of his intent, can learn with how great a master they
are communing.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Doubtless, he was a great discoverer. But it is for
the spirit of his labours, even more than for the establishment of new
doctrine, that English surgery is for ever indebted to him. Of facts in
pathology, he may, perhaps, be no permanent teacher; but to the student
of medicine he must always be a noble pattern. Emphatically, it may be
said of him, that he was the physiological surgeon. Others, before him
(Galen, for instance, eminently), had been at once physiologists and
practitioners; but science, in
their case, had come little into contact with practice. Never had
physiology been so incorporated with surgery, never been so applied to
the investigation of disease and the suggestion of treatment, as it was
by this master-workman of ours. And to him, so far as such obligations
can be personal, we assuredly owe it that, for the last half-century,
the foundations of English surgery have, at least professedly, been
changing from a basis of empiricism to a basis of science.&rsquo; <i>Simon on
Inflammation</i>, in <i>A System of Surgery</i>, edited by T. Holmes, London,
1860, vol. i. pp. 134&ndash;136.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_908_908" id="Footnote_908_908"></a><a href="#FNanchor_908_908"><span class="label">[908]</span></a> Mr. Bowman, in his <i>Principles of Surgery</i> (<i>Encyclopædia
of the Medical Sciences</i>, London, 4to, 1847) says (p. 831): &lsquo;Before the
time of Hunter, the operation was performed by cutting into the sac of
the aneurism, and tying the vessel above and below. So formidable was
this proceeding in its consequences, that amputation of the limb was
frequently preferred, as a less dangerous and fatal measure. The genius
of Hunter led him to tie the femoral artery, in a case of popliteal
aneurism, leaving the tumour untouched. The safety and efficacy of this
mode of operating have now been fully established, and the principle has
been extended to all operations for the cure of this formidable
disease.&rsquo; See also p. 873; <i>Paget's Surgical Pathology</i>, vol. i. pp. 36,
37; and <i>Erichsen's Surgery</i>, pp. 141, 142, 508, 509.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_909_909" id="Footnote_909_909"></a><a href="#FNanchor_909_909"><span class="label">[909]</span></a> &lsquo;The majority of Hunter's contemporaries considered his
pursuits to have little connexion with practice, charged him with
attending to physiology more than surgery, and looked on him as little
better than an innovator and an enthusiast.&rsquo; <i>Ottley's Life of Hunter</i>,
p. 126. In a work, which was written by a surgeon only the year after
Hunter died, the reader is told, in regard to his remarkable inquiries
respecting animal heat, that &lsquo;his experiments, if they be true, carry
with them no manner of information:&mdash;if they be true, no effect for the
benefit of man can possibly be derived from them.&rsquo; <i>Foot's Life of
Hunter</i>, London, 1794, p. 116. At p. 225, the same practitioner
reproaches the great philosopher with propounding &lsquo;purely a piece of
theory, without any practical purpose whatever.&rsquo; Foot, indeed, wrote
under the influence of personal feelings, but he rightly judged that
these were the sort of charges which would be most likely to prejudice
the English public against Hunter. It never occurred to Foot, any more
than it would occur to his readers, that the quest of truth, as truth,
is a magnificent object, even if its practical benefit is imperceptible.
One other testimony is worth quoting. Sir Astley Cooper writes of Cline:
&lsquo;His high opinion of Mr. Hunter shows his judgment; for almost all
others of Mr. Hunter's contemporaries, although they praise him now,
abused him while he lived.&rsquo; <i>The Life of Sir Astley Cooper, by Bransby
Blake Cooper</i>, London, 1843, vol. ii. p. 337.</p></div>

alone; and their actions often appear unaccountable, nay, even
extravagant, to their distant followers, who know not the causes that
give rise to them, nor the effects which they are designed to produce.
In such a situation stood Mr. Hunter, with relation to his
contemporaries. It was a comfortless precedence, for it deprived him of
sympathy and social co-operation.&rsquo; <i>Abernathy's Hunterian Oration</i>, p.

of their towns and cities which are inhabited by the poorest classes,

improvement, may be freed from those causes and sources of contagion
which, if allowed to remain, will infallibly breed pestilence, and be
fruitful in death, in spite of all the prayers and fastings of a united,
but inactive nation.&rsquo;</p></div>
